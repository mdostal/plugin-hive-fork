"""s9-plan-wire — planning-routing seam tests.

Verifies:
  AC1: When planning_mode_decision==multica, planning-routing routes to the
       DAG front door (plan.workflow.yaml, binding=multica), not per-persona
       plan-mode-multica dispatch.
  AC2: When backend is unset (default mode), existing direct/local behaviour is
       preserved — no DAG dispatch.
  AC3: plan.workflow.yaml does NOT contain retired narrated-path review step IDs
       while allowing executor-owned user_gate sentinels on the graduated DAG
       path.
