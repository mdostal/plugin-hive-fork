"""DAG executor for Hive workflows.

Local Python module per architect's plugin-packaging lock; not in
plugin.json. The marketplace surface continues to be the existing
`/execute` skill, which invokes this executor when the consumer-side
flag (`.pHive/hive.config.yaml`) is on AND the workflow appears in the
graduation registry (`.pHive/runtime/executor-graduated-workflows.yaml`).

Default behaviour is OFF — orchestrator-narrated path. Schema evolution
stays under maintainer control until the surface is stable.

Public surface for `skills/execute` and tests:

    load_executor_config(repo_root) -> dict
    is_workflow_graduated(workflow_name, repo_root) -> bool
    executor_enabled_for(workflow_name, repo_root) -> bool
    run_workflow(workflow_path, ...) -> dict[str, NodeOutput]
