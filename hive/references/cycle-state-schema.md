# Cycle State Schema

The cycle state document is a structured, machine-readable file that accumulates decisions as a workflow runs. Every agent receives it as context — preventing re-debating settled decisions.

## Storage Path

```
.pHive/cycle-state/{epic-id}.yaml
```

Created at epic start, updated after each phase completes.

`stories` field — required for `append` placement (empty list is invalid); informational for `pre-exec`/`post-exec` (empty list is valid — phase spawns regardless of story scope).

### Phase records — scope-drift fields

`phase_records[]` captures per-phase scope at boundary crossings.
`expected_scope`, `delivered_scope`, and `delta_reasons` are the data
shape the `scope_drift_score` metric (story `ed-3-drift-metric-emit`)
consumes.

| Field | Type | Required when | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `phase` | string | Always | Phase label (`research`, `architecture`, `implement`, `review`, `test`, `integrate`, etc.). Must be unique within `phase_records[]`. |
| `started_at` | string | Always | ISO 8601 timestamp when the phase began. |
| `completed_at` | string | Before phase exit | ISO 8601 timestamp when the phase finished. Absent while the phase is in flight. |
| `expected_scope` | `list[str]` | Before phase exit | Items the orchestrator declared the phase was expected to deliver. Free-text bullets — one item per logical unit (decision, deliverable, file group, etc.). |
| `delivered_scope` | `list[str]` | Before phase exit | Items the phase actually delivered, at the same granularity as `expected_scope`. |
| `delta_reasons` | `list[enum]` | Before phase exit whenever the two scope lists diverge | One or more enum values explaining *why* delivered differs from expected. Empty list when the two scopes match exactly. |

All scope-drift fields are **optional on initial write** (the
orchestrator may seed `expected_scope` at phase start and leave the
other two empty) and **required before the phase record's
`completed_at` is set** — i.e., the record must carry all three fields
before the phase is considered exited.

### `delta_reasons` enum

Values are identical in [cross-swarm-handoff.md](cross-swarm-handoff.md).
The enum is **additive** — new values may be introduced in a follow-up
patch story without bumping any major schema version. Consumers MUST
ignore unknown values gracefully rather than rejecting the document.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `rescope` | Phase was explicitly rescoped mid-flight by planner direction; expected_scope shifted before delivery. |
| `scope-creep` | Phase delivered MORE than expected without an explicit rescope. |
| `deferred` | Expected item was intentionally moved to a later phase or story. |
| `blocked` | Expected item could not be delivered due to an external block (dependency unmet, infra unavailable); acknowledged drift, not silent loss. |
| `misunderstood-ac` | Acceptance criterion was interpreted differently than authored; delivered work does not match author intent. |
| `out-of-band-work` | Work landed that was not in any `expected_scope` (e.g., emergency fix during research). |

## How It Works

### Creation
At epic start, the orchestrator creates a minimal cycle state with `epic_id`, `created`, and any known constraints from the story specs.

### Updates
After each phase completes, the orchestrator extracts key decisions from the agent's output and appends them. Extraction targets:
- Technology choices ("we'll use X for Y")
- Naming conventions ("the component is called X")
- Scope decisions ("X is out of scope because Y")
- Architectural constraints ("X must use Y pattern")

### Injection
Every downstream agent receives the cycle state as a system-level constraint in their prompt. It goes before the task description so it acts as a frame, not an afterthought.

```
[System context — Cycle State]
The following decisions have been made and are not up for debate:
{cycle state YAML}

[Task]
{actual step instructions}
```

### Cross-Swarm Transfer
When a planning swarm hands off to a dev swarm, the cycle state transfers as part of the handoff. The dev swarm's agents receive all planning decisions as constraints.

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `epic_id` | string | Epic this state belongs to |
| `created` | string | ISO 8601 creation timestamp |
| `updated` | string | ISO 8601 last update timestamp |
| `decisions` | list | Accumulated decisions — canonical format: `{phase, key, value, rationale, timestamp}`. Legacy files using `{decision, rationale}` shorthand update to canonical format on next orchestrator write — no bulk migration required. |

## Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `product_name` | string | Product name if applicable |
| `constraints` | list | Hard constraints that apply to all phases |
| `naming` | object | Naming conventions (product, package, API prefix, etc.) |
| `scope_boundaries` | object | Explicit in-scope and out-of-scope items |
| `technology` | object | Technology stack decisions |
| `linear` | object | Linear ticket ID mapping (see below) |
| `escalations` | list | Specialist team escalation flags raised during planning. See specialist-triggers.md catalog for valid trigger IDs. |
| `phase_records` | list | Per-phase boundary records carrying `expected_scope`, `delivered_scope`, and `delta_reasons`. See `Phase records — scope-drift fields` above. |
| `handoff_log` | list | Per-story terminal handoff records written by `/execute` step 7c. See `Terminal handoff log` below. |
| `routing_decisions` | list | Per-item routing records written by `/standup --interactive` Phase 1.5. See `Interactive routing decisions` below. |
| `autonomous_cycle` | object | Per-cycle bookkeeping written by the autonomous-cycle-loop runner. Foundation field — see `Autonomous cycle bookkeeping` below. |
| `hermes_reconciler` | object | Cross-tick persistent memory for the Hermes reconciler. Additive + absence-tolerant — see `Hermes reconciler state` below. |
| `persona_dispatch` | object | Per-story alternative completion record, keyed by story ID. See `Persona dispatch alternative completion record` below. |

## Persona dispatch alternative completion record

Per story `wr-1-completion-record-detector` (`hive/lib/completion_record_detector.py`),
a story with **no** `.pHive/episodes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/` directory at all is still
accepted as having a completion record when the cycle state carries a conformant
`persona_dispatch.<story-id>` entry. This is the OR-fallback: the detector evaluates
the episode directory and this cycle-state entry **independently** and warns only when
**neither** is conformant. It exists for dialects (e.g. `cc-workflows-run.yaml`,
`dag-run.yaml`) that record per-agent completion directly on the cycle state instead of
writing a per-story episode marker file.

### Shape

```yaml
persona_dispatch:
  <story-id>:
    agents:
      - persona: developer
        verdict: pass
      - persona: reviewer
        verdict: pass
```

### Field semantics

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `persona_dispatch.<story-id>` | object | — | Present only for stories using the alternative record; absent stories fall through to the episode-directory check. |
| `persona_dispatch.<story-id>.agents` | list | yes | One entry per dispatched agent for this story. Must be non-empty. |
| `persona_dispatch.<story-id>.agents[].persona` | string | yes | Non-empty persona name (e.g. `developer`, `reviewer`). |
| `persona_dispatch.<story-id>.agents[].verdict` | enum | yes | `pass`, `fail`, or `needs-revision`. |

### Writer / honorer / absence semantics

- **Writer:** the orchestrator (or dispatch tooling for `cc-workflows-run.yaml`/`dag-run.yaml`-style
  flows) appends one `agents[]` entry per dispatched agent as each agent reaches a terminal verdict.
- **Honorer:** `hive/lib/completion_record_detector.py` reads this block only when the story's episode
  directory is missing, empty, or fails validation — it never overrides a conformant episode-directory
  record.
- **Absence:** no `persona_dispatch` key, or no entry for a given story ID, is not itself a malformed
  record — it means "this story doesn't use the alternative record," and the detector falls back to the
  episode-directory check as the sole source of truth. A **present but invalid** entry (e.g. empty
  `agents[]`, missing `persona`, or an out-of-enum `verdict`) is malformed and warns, even when the
  episode directory is also missing.

## Interactive routing decisions

Written by `/standup --interactive` Phase 1.5 (story `a-2-standup-routing-step-and-heuristic`) after
each interactive routing pass. One row per presented item regardless of route chosen. Prior rows are
preserved across runs — the array is append-only; old entries are read to enforce the 7-day
keep-local suppression window.

### Shape

```yaml
routing_decisions:
  - item_id: t-001                        # triage entry id or story id
    item_type: triage                     # triage | story
    route: keep-local                     # push-to-github | keep-local | defer
    visibility: local                     # heuristic recommendation: local | sandcastle | either
    confidence: high                      # low | medium | high
    operator_override: false              # true when operator chose against heuristic recommendation
    reasoning: "UI work — description contains 'component', 'screen'"
    applied_at: "2026-05-21T10:30:00Z"   # ISO 8601
    expires_at: "2026-05-28T10:30:00Z"   # present only when route=keep-local (applied_at + 7 days)
```

### Field semantics

| Field | Type | Required when | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `item_id` | string | Always | Stable identifier of the routed item. Matches `id` in triage queue or story YAML. |
| `item_type` | string | Always | `triage` or `story`. |
| `route` | string | Always | Operator-confirmed routing decision: `push-to-github`, `keep-local`, or `defer`. |
| `visibility` | string | Always | Heuristic recommendation: `local`, `sandcastle`, or `either`. |
| `confidence` | string | Always | Heuristic confidence: `low`, `medium`, or `high`. |
| `operator_override` | bool | Always | `true` when the operator's choice differed from the heuristic recommendation. |
| `reasoning` | string | Always | One-line heuristic reasoning citing the dominant signal(s). |
| `applied_at` | string | Always | ISO 8601 timestamp when the decision was recorded. |
| `expires_at` | string | When `route: keep-local` | ISO 8601 timestamp 7 days after `applied_at`. The next standup run suppresses this item until this timestamp passes. Absent for `push-to-github` and `defer` entries. |

### Suppression semantics

At the start of each `/standup --interactive` routing pass, the orchestrator checks
`routing_decisions[]` for entries where `route: keep-local` and `expires_at > now`.
Any matching `item_id` is excluded from the presented item list for that run.
Once `expires_at` passes, the item surfaces again normally.

The 7-day window is fixed at write time and is not extended by additional
`keep-local` decisions on the same item unless the operator routes it again.

### Write target

Primary target: `.pHive/cycle-state/<focus-epic-id>.yaml`

When no focus epic is passed and multiple epics are in-flight:
`.pHive/cycle-state/_standup.yaml` (shared cross-epic routing log).

## Terminal handoff log

Written by `/execute` step 7c (story `d-1-handoff-dispatch-and-execute-wire`) after each story's
integrate step when `terminal_handoff.next` (or the epic/global default) is not `none`. One row
per dispatched story regardless of verdict.

### Shape

```yaml
handoff_log:
  - story_id: <string>           # story that triggered the handoff
    target: test | review | both | none   # resolved target (never 'none' in practice — rows not written for none)
    started_at: "<ISO 8601>"     # when dispatchHandoff was called
    finished_at: "<ISO 8601>"    # when it returned
    verdict: <string>            # passed | needs-revision | needs-optimization | failed | error | skipped | timeout
    evidence_ref: <string>       # path to .pHive/handoff-evidence/<story>-<target>-<ts>.md, or "" on error
    duration_ms: <int>           # wall-clock ms from start to finish
    skipped_reason: <string>     # present only when verdict=skipped; e.g. "no-integrate-episode"
    timeout_at: "<ISO 8601>"     # present only when verdict=timeout; ISO 8601 timestamp when the timeout fired
```

### Field semantics

| Field | Type | Required when | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `story_id` | string | Always | Matches the story's `id` field in the story YAML. |
| `target` | string | Always | The resolved `terminal_handoff.next` value that triggered dispatch. |
| `started_at` | string | Always | ISO 8601 timestamp. Set by the orchestrator before calling `dispatchHandoff`. |
| `finished_at` | string | Always | ISO 8601 timestamp. Set after `dispatchHandoff` returns. |
| `verdict` | string | Always | Terminal verdict. `skipped` indicates the integrate episode marker was absent. |
| `evidence_ref` | string | Always | Relative path from the project root to the evidence file, or `""` when evidence could not be written. |
| `duration_ms` | int | Always | Rounded wall-clock duration. `0` for skipped rows. |
| `skipped_reason` | string | When `verdict: skipped` | Short machine-readable reason. `"no-integrate-episode"` is the only defined value. |
| `timeout_at` | string | When `verdict: timeout` | ISO 8601 timestamp recorded by `dispatch.mjs` at the moment the wall-clock timeout fired. A companion `phase_handoff_timeout` JSONL event is also written to `.pHive/metrics/events/`. |

### Verdict enum

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `passed` | All dispatched skills (test and/or review) produced a passing verdict. |
| `needs-revision` | Review produced `needs-revision` or test produced `failed`. |
| `needs-optimization` | Review produced `needs-optimization` and test (if run) passed. |
| `failed` | Test skill reported explicit failures. |
| `error` | Dispatch could not determine a verdict (spawn error, unrecognised output). |
| `skipped` | Handoff was not attempted because the integrate episode marker was absent. |
| `timeout` | The child process hit the wall-clock timeout. A `phase_handoff_timeout` JSONL event is emitted and `/execute` logs and continues — the timeout does not block the next story. |

## Linear Ticket Tracking

The `linear` section maps Hive artifacts to Linear issue IDs. This is the source of truth — the orchestrator reads this instead of querying Linear for ID lookups.

```yaml
linear:
  epic_issue_id: "ACME-1"           # Linear parent issue for this epic
  user_id: "your-user-uuid-here"    # Cached user ID for assignment locking
  stories:
    task-tracking-integration:
      issue_id: "ACME-2"
      status: "In Progress"
      assignee: "your-user-uuid-here"  # null when unlocked
      branch: "acme-2-task-tracking-integration"
    daily-ceremony-workflow:
      issue_id: "ACME-3"
      status: "Todo"
      assignee: null
  bugs:
    - issue_id: "ACME-4"
      parent_story: "task-tracking-integration"
      status: "Done"
      title: "null check missing in payment validator"
```

### When Fields Are Written

| Field | Written During | By |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| `epic_issue_id` | Planning (epic parent created) | Orchestrator |
| `stories.{id}.issue_id` | Planning (story sub-issues created) | Orchestrator |
| `stories.{id}.status` | Each phase transition | Orchestrator/Team Lead |
| `stories.{id}.assignee` | Execution claim / session-end release | Orchestrator/Team Lead |
| `stories.{id}.branch` | Execution (branch created) | Team Lead |
| `bugs[]` | Fix loop (bug sub-issues created) | Test Sentinel / Orchestrator |
| `user_id` | Session start (resolved from config or linearis) | Orchestrator |

## Coexistence with `run_state.yaml`

The DAG executor (epic `hive-dag-executor`, story `hde-5`) introduces a **second** state file with a deliberately separate scope. The two files coexist; they do **not** mirror each other.

| File | Path | Scope | Owner | Lifetime |
|------|------|-------|-------|----------|
| `cycle-state.yaml` | `.pHive/cycle-state/{epic_id}.yaml` | Epic-level decision log accumulated across phases | Orchestrator (read by every agent prompt) | Persists with the epic |
| `run_state.yaml` | `.pHive/runs/{run_id}/run_state.yaml` | Per-workflow-execution durable state — node statuses, output graph, last successful node, failure info | DAG executor walker | Per executor invocation; may be cleaned up after completion |

### What lives where

| Concern | Cycle state | Run state |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| User-gate decisions, sign-offs, escalations | yes | no |
| Per-story status (`pending` / `in_progress` / `done`) | yes | no |
| Per-node status within a single executor run (`running` / `completed` / `failed`) | no | yes |
| Materialized output graph for resume | no | yes |
| `last_successful_node_id` for `--resume` checkpoints | no | yes |
| Failure info captured at executor halt | no | yes |
| `schema_version` (pinned at 0 from day one) | no | yes |

### Why the split

`cycle-state.yaml` exists to keep agent prompts coherent across the lifetime of an epic — settled decisions stay settled. `run_state.yaml` exists to make a single executor invocation resumable without conflating that with the epic's decision log. Mixing them blurs ownership and bloats both files (Risk #4 in `hive-dag-executor` epic registry).

### The two files do not mirror each other

A node completing inside a single executor run writes to `run_state.yaml.node_statuses` and `run_state.yaml.output_graph` — the cycle state is unaffected. Conversely, a user-gate decision or escalation banked at planning time writes to `cycle-state.yaml` and never appears in any run_state. Code that needs to update both for the same data point is a sign of blurred ownership; route through the `hive.lib.dag_executor.run_state.store` narrow-mutation API for run-state writes and through the orchestrator's cycle-state writers for epic-level writes.

## Hermes reconciler state

Per the `hermes-core-loop-mvp` epic (story `s2-hermes-reconciler-state`), the cycle state document may carry an optional `hermes_reconciler:` block that the Hermes reconciler uses as cross-tick persistent memory. The block is **optional** and **additive** — pre-existing cycle states continue to validate without edits. Readers must apply safe defaults when the block or any individual field is absent.

The block is implemented in `hive/lib/hermes-reconciler/state.mjs`, which provides `readHermesReconcilerState(cycleStatePath)` and `writeHermesReconcilerState(cycleStatePath, updates)`. Writes are atomic (temp file + rename) and preserve all other top-level blocks verbatim.

### Shape

```yaml
hermes_reconciler:
  gate_state: null              # "pre_approved" to enable the reconciler; null/absent → abort tick
  in_flight_story_id: null      # story-id string of the currently dispatched story, or null
  in_flight_task_id: null       # Multica task UUID of the active agent run, or null
  dispatched_at: null           # ISO8601 timestamp written at dispatch (watchdog-authoritative)
  current_phase: null           # "dispatched_impl" | "dispatched_review" — phase_position of the in-flight story, or null
  stuck_after_seconds: 1800     # watchdog threshold: seconds before a dispatch is considered stuck
  stories:
    <story-id>:
      phase_position: pending   # pending|dispatched_impl|impl_terminal|dispatched_review|review_terminal|done|blocked
      attempt: 0                # dispatch attempt count (increments on each impl dispatch)
      review_loop_count: 0      # number of review→revision loops completed for this story
      verdict: null             # raw "passed" | "needs_revision" | null (set at review_terminal); normalized to "needs-revision" (hyphen) before loop-back comparison — see cycle-reconciler.md §6
```

### Field semantics

| Field | Type | Default | Mutating lifecycle event |
|-------|------|---------|--------------------------|
| `gate_state` | string \| null | `null` | Written by operator or gate-lift script; `null` blocks the reconciler preflight |
| `in_flight_story_id` | string \| null | `null` | Written at dispatch (impl or review); cleared when the story reaches a terminal phase |
| `in_flight_task_id` | string \| null | `null` | Written at dispatch (one atomic op with `in_flight_story_id`, `dispatched_at`, `current_phase`); cleared at terminal |
| `dispatched_at` | string \| null | `null` | ISO8601; written at dispatch — the watchdog uses this to detect stuck dispatches |
| `current_phase` | string \| null | `null` | `"dispatched_impl"` when an impl agent is running; `"dispatched_review"` when a review agent is running; `null` otherwise. Mirrors the in-flight story's `phase_position`. |
| `stuck_after_seconds` | int | `1800` | Configurable watchdog threshold; rarely mutated |
| `stories.<id>.phase_position` | string | `"pending"` | Advances through the phase state machine: `pending → dispatched_impl → impl_terminal → dispatched_review → review_terminal → done` (or `blocked`) |
| `stories.<id>.attempt` | int | `0` | Incremented each time an impl dispatch is issued for this story |
| `stories.<id>.review_loop_count` | int | `0` | Incremented each time a `needs_revision` verdict triggers a new impl dispatch |
| `stories.<id>.verdict` | string \| null | `null` | Set to `"passed"` or raw `"needs_revision"` when a review agent reaches `review_terminal`. The reconciler normalizes the raw verdict to canonical `"needs-revision"` (hyphen) before the loop-back comparison — see `cycle-reconciler.md` §6 (`normalizeVerdict`). |

### `phase_position` state machine

```
pending
  └─► dispatched_impl      (impl agent dispatched)
        └─► impl_terminal  (agent reached terminal status)
              └─► dispatched_review   (review agent dispatched)
                    └─► review_terminal (review agent reached terminal status)
                          ├─► done     (verdict: "passed")
                          └─► dispatched_impl  (verdict: "needs_revision" — loops back)
              └─► blocked  (max attempts exceeded or hard error)
```

### Preflight gate

`gate_state: null` (or absent) → `readHermesReconcilerState` returns `{gate_state: null, ...defaults}` and the reconciler preflight returns `{wakeAgent: false}`, aborting the tick without mutation.

`gate_state: "pre_approved"` → preflight proceeds to full state evaluation.

### Dispatch atomicity

When a story is dispatched (impl or review), the reconciler MUST write `in_flight_story_id`, `in_flight_task_id`, `dispatched_at`, and `current_phase` in a **single** `writeHermesReconcilerState` call so the file is never in a partially-written dispatch state.

## Autonomous cycle bookkeeping

Per the `autonomous-cycle-loop` epic (story `s0-1-schema-and-config-bump`), the cycle state document may carry an optional `autonomous_cycle:` block that the loop runner uses to record cross-cycle bookkeeping. The block is **optional** and **additive** — pre-existing cycle states continue to validate without edits, and orchestrator writers must tolerate its absence on read.

### Shape

```yaml
autonomous_cycle:
  enabled: true | false        # true iff this cycle state was advanced by the loop runner
                               # (mirrors autonomous_cycle_loop.enabled at the moment of write)
  cycle_count: <int>           # how many full loop iterations have completed against this epic
  last_cycle_at: "<ISO 8601>"  # timestamp of the most recent loop completion; absent before the

### Field semantics

| Field | Type | Required when | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | Always (within the block) | Snapshots `autonomous_cycle_loop.enabled` at write time. Lets a future reader tell apart "this epic ran the loop while it was off" from "this epic ran the loop while it was on." |
| `cycle_count` | int | Always (within the block) | Monotonic; the runner increments at the end of each loop iteration before persisting. |
| `last_cycle_at` | string | After first cycle | ISO 8601 timestamp. Absent on initial block creation; written after the runner's first complete pass. |
| `scenarios_run` | `list[str]` | After first cycle | Scenario IDs in replay order. May be empty if the loop fired but found no scenarios under `autonomous_cycle_loop.test_scenarios_path`. |
| `outcomes` | `list[object]` | After first cycle | One entry per `scenarios_run` entry, same index. `status` values map directly to the loop's reported terminal state; `reason` is required for `fail` and `inconclusive`. |

### Foundation status

This story (`s0-1-schema-and-config-bump`) ships the schema only. No writer emits the block yet — the loop runner that consumes
`autonomous_cycle_loop.*` and writes this block lands in a later story of the `autonomous-cycle-loop` epic.

Until the runner ships, the field is inert and orchestrator writers continue to omit it. Pre-existing cycle state files require no migration. Readers should treat absence as "no autonomous cycle has run against this epic," which is byte-equivalent to the prior behavior.
