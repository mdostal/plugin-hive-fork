# Agent Config Schema

Every agent persona file includes a YAML frontmatter block at the top. The frontmatter contains both **official Claude Code plugin fields** (parsed by the runtime) and **Hive-specific fields** (parsed by the orchestrator and team lead).

## Format

YAML frontmatter is delimited by `---` at the top of the agent markdown file:

```markdown
---
# === Official Claude Code fields (parsed by runtime) ===
name: agent-name
description: "Short description of what this agent does and when it's triggered."

# === Hive-specific fields (parsed by orchestrator/team lead) ===

## Official Fields (Claude Code Runtime)

These fields are parsed and used by the Claude Code plugin system.

### name (required)
Kebab-case identifier for the agent. 3-50 characters, lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must start and end with alphanumeric.

### description (required)
Describes when Claude should trigger this agent. For Hive agents (spawned by orchestrator, not auto-triggered), a short functional description suffices. For auto-triggered agents, include `<example>` blocks.

### model (required)
Which model the agent runs on.

| Value | Model | Use for |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `opus` | claude-opus-4-8 | Complex reasoning, coordination, architecture, requirements |
| `sonnet` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Analytical work, implementation, review, test design |
| `haiku` | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 | Fast mechanical execution (running tests, collecting results) |
| `inherit` | Same as parent | When agent should match the spawning session's model |

Must match the agent's tier in `hive.config.yaml` unless `model_overrides` applies.

### color (required)
Visual identifier in the UI. Options: `blue`, `cyan`, `green`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `red`.

Color assignments by role:
- **Red:** Orchestrator, team lead, test sentinel (coordination, gatekeeping)
- **Blue:** Architect, analyst (planning, design)
- **Green:** Developers, test worker (implementation, execution)
- **Yellow:** Tester, reviewer, peer-validator (quality, validation)
- **Cyan:** Researcher, pair-programmer, test-scout (exploration, advisory)
- **Magenta:** UI designer, technical writer (creative, document production)

### tools (optional)
Array of Claude Code tool names the agent can use. Capitalized. If omitted, agent has access to all tools.

```yaml
tools: ["Grep", "Glob", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "Bash"]
```

Common tool sets:
- Read-only: `["Grep", "Glob", "Read"]`
- Implementation: `["Grep", "Glob", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "Bash"]`
- Execution: `["Read", "Bash"]`

## Hive-Specific Fields

These fields are ignored by the Claude Code runtime but parsed by the Hive orchestrator and team lead when spawning agents.

### knowledge (required)
List of knowledge sources the agent should read or write. Each entry has:

- `path`: path to the knowledge source. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths.
- `use-when`: description of when this knowledge source is relevant. Guides the spawner on when to load it.

The primary knowledge source for every agent is its memory directory:
```yaml
knowledge:
  - path: ~/.claude/hive/memories/{agent-name}/
    use-when: "Read past insights, patterns, and pitfalls before starting work. Write insights when encountering reusable patterns or lessons learned."
```

Additional knowledge sources can include project docs, reference materials, or shared team knowledge.

### skills (optional)
Skills this agent can use. The team lead or orchestrator injects the skill content when the trigger condition matches.

```yaml
skills:
  - path: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/research-brief/SKILL.md
    use-when: "conducting deep codebase or web research"
```

- `path`: path to the skill file. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths.
- `use-when`: one-line description of when this skill applies. The team lead evaluates this against the current task.

### tools (required)
List of Claude Code tools this agent is allowed to use. Keep this minimal — agents should only have the tools they need.

Common tool sets:
- **Research agents**: `grep`, `glob`, `read`, `bash` (read-only commands)
- **Developer agents**: `grep`, `glob`, `read`, `edit`, `write`, `bash`
- **Review agents**: `grep`, `glob`, `read`
- **Orchestrator**: `grep`, `glob`, `ls`, `read`

### required_tools (optional)
External tools (MCP servers or CLI tools) this agent needs beyond the built-in Claude Code tools. The spawner validates availability before spawning.

```yaml
required_tools:
  - name: cli-anything-frame-zero
    type: cli
    fallback: "Produce text-based layout specs instead of .f0 files"
  - name: firecrawl
    type: mcp
    fallback: "Use WebSearch/WebFetch built-in tools"
```

- `name`: tool identifier (CLI command name or MCP server name).
- `type`: `cli` or `mcp`.
- `fallback`: what the agent should do if the tool is unavailable. If no fallback, the spawn is blocked.

### domain (required)
File path patterns controlling where this agent can read, write, and delete. Each entry specifies a path glob and permissions.

```yaml
domain:
  - path: src/components/**
    read: true
    write: true
    delete: false
  - path: src/api/**
    read: true
    write: false
    delete: false
  - path: .
    read: true
    write: false
    delete: false
```

- `path`: glob pattern for files/directories.
- `read`: whether the agent can read files matching this pattern.
- `write`: whether the agent can modify or create files matching this pattern.
- `delete`: whether the agent can delete files matching this pattern.
- Enforcement is by the team lead (post-step validation) and reviewer (code review checklist).
- Team config can override agent-level domains for project-specific scoping.
- More specific paths take precedence over less specific ones.
- A catch-all `path: .` entry with `read: true, write: false, delete: false` gives read-everywhere as a safe default.

## What Goes in Frontmatter vs Agent Body

| In Frontmatter | In Agent Body |
|----------------|---------------|
| name, model_tier | Identity ("You are a...") |
| knowledge sources | Areas of expertise |
| domain restrictions | How you work (behavioral guidance) |
| skills list | Quality standards |
| tools, required_tools | Output format |
| | Scope discipline rules |

**Rule of thumb:** if the orchestrator/team lead needs it to spawn or validate the agent, it's frontmatter. If the agent needs it to do its job well, it's body.

### Prompt-Language Slots

Reusable prompt-language slots live in the agent body, not in frontmatter. This is where you put short, portable posture statements that should survive model upgrades and be easy to reuse across personas, such as a `design for next model` slot. Treat the matching lines in [architect.md](../agents/architect.md) and [tpm.md](../agents/tpm.md) as the canonical examples for that pattern: one sentence, same wording, placed in the system-prompt prose where it shapes how the persona reasons.

## Interaction with hive.config.yaml

`hive.config.yaml` defines project-level defaults:
- `model_tiers`: default tier assignments for all agents
- `model_overrides`: per-agent overrides (takes precedence over agent frontmatter)

Agent frontmatter `model_tier` must match `hive.config.yaml` tiers. If `model_overrides` exists for an agent, the override wins at spawn time.

## Nesting Depth Ceiling (max_spawn_depth)

Claude Code enforces a hard maximum spawn depth of **5**. This is a runtime constraint, not a configurable field — there is no `max_spawn_depth` key in agent frontmatter or `hive.config.yaml` to set.

| Depth | Agent tool present | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| 1–4 | Yes | Agent can spawn children |
| 5 | **No** | Tool omitted; spawning silently unavailable |

Design agent trees so that any agent needing to spawn children sits at depth ≤ 4. The depth ceiling applies to recursive `Agent(name:)` calls (see [`agent-teams-guide.md`](agent-teams-guide.md) for the teammate mechanism). It is independent of `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`, which gates only parallel dispatch.

## Interaction with Team Config

Team configs (at `.pHive/teams/{team-name}.yaml`) can override agent-level domains for project-specific scoping:

```yaml
# In team config
members:
  - agent: frontend-developer
    domain:
      - path: src/app/**
        read: true
        write: true
        delete: false
```

Precedence: team config domain > agent frontmatter domain > default.
