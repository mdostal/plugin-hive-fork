# Permission Patterns

Per-workflow recommendations for minimizing permission prompts during Hive execution. These
are recommendations for users to add to their project's `.claude/settings.json` — Hive does
not configure permissions automatically. Hive does not ship a project settings file.

## Why Permission Prompts Happen

Claude Code prompts for approval when a command is unfamiliar or potentially destructive. Hive agents trigger excessive prompts when they:

1. **Use shell variable assignments** — `PG1="abc"` triggers "command contains newlines"
2. **Improvise CLI commands** — unknown flags or syntax patterns
3. **Use the Write tool for managed files** — writing .f0 JSON directly instead of using CLI
4. **Use multi-line commands** — backslash continuation triggers approval

Step files prevent most of these by providing exact command templates. This document covers the remaining cases where project-level permission configuration helps.

## Per-Workflow Allowlists

### UI Design Workflow

Frame0 CLI commands are sandboxed to .f0 files and non-destructive. Pre-approve all.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(cli-anything-frame-zero*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** User feedback — "I should never need to approve a Frame0 CLI command. It's wireframing. I don't care if it destroys all the wireframes."

### Development Workflow

Build, test, and lint commands are read-only or produce expected artifacts.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm test*)",
      "Bash(npm run build*)",
      "Bash(npm run lint*)",
      "Bash(./gradlew *)",
      "Bash(pytest*)",
      "Bash(cargo test*)",
      "Bash(cargo build*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Adapt to your project's actual build/test commands. The pattern is: allow the commands your CI already runs.

### Test Swarm Workflow

Test runners and device commands.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(maestro *)",
      "Bash(npm test*)",
      "Bash(pytest*)",
      "Bash(./gradlew test*)",
      "Bash(xcrun *)",
      "Bash(adb *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Daily Ceremony

Read-only git and state queries.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git status*)",
      "Bash(git log*)",
      "Bash(git diff*)",
      "Bash(git branch*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Parameter-Level Matching

Claude Code permission rules can now match on individual tool **parameters**, not just the
tool name or the leading Bash command. This is **generally available** — no flag or preview
gate required. It lets you write precise allow/deny rules for tools that take structured
input (Edit, Write, MCP calls) where a bare tool name is too coarse.

### Syntax

```
Tool(param:value)
```

- `param` is a named field on the tool's input (e.g. `file_path` for Edit/Write, `command`
  for Bash, `url` for WebFetch).
- `value` is matched literally, with `*` as a wildcard (same glob semantics as the existing
  tool-name patterns like `Bash(npm test*)`).
- Multiple constraints can target the same tool across separate rules; deny rules win over
  allow rules.
- File rules are resolved from the Claude Code process's current working directory. For a
  recursive project-relative path, use `dir/**/*` (for example,
  `Edit(file_path:hive/**/*)`). Do not use the legacy single-segment `dir/**` form: current
  Claude Code narrows that form to the directory itself rather than all descendants.
- Keep `file_path:` on Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, and Glob permission rules. Bare tool rules
  such as `"Write"`, `"NotebookEdit"`, or `"Glob"` are deprecated because they grant the
  entire tool instead of expressing the intended path boundary.

### Worked Hive Examples

These use real Hive tooling and the paths Hive agents actually touch.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Edit(file_path:.pHive/**/*)",
      "Edit(file_path:hive/references/**/*)",
      "Write(file_path:.pHive/episodes/**/*)",
      "Write(file_path:.pHive/cycle-state/**/*)",
      "Bash(command:git status*)",
      "Bash(command:./gradlew test*)",
      "mcp__plugin_context-mode_context-mode__ctx_execute(language:shell)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Edit(file_path:hive/lib/dag_executor/**/*)",
      "Edit(file_path:**/.claude/settings.json)",
      "Write(file_path:**/.env*)",
      "Bash(command:git push*)",
      "Bash(command:rm -rf*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

What each rule does, in Hive terms:

- `Edit(file_path:.pHive/**/*)` — let a planning agent freely edit epic/story YAML and
  cycle-state under `.pHive/` without prompting on every file.
- `Write(file_path:.pHive/episodes/**/*)` — allow episode markers (the artifacts
  `multica_episode` and ship reconciliation write) without approval.
- `Edit(file_path:hive/lib/dag_executor/**/*)` in **deny** — protect the canonical Python DAG
  executor from incidental edits by a docs- or planning-scoped agent.
- `Bash(command:git push*)` in **deny** — keeps outbound publishing gated even when a broad
  `Bash(command:git *)` allow exists elsewhere (deny precedence).
- `mcp__..._ctx_execute(language:shell)` — pre-approve sandbox shell execution (the routed
  replacement for raw Bash under the context-mode rules) while leaving other languages to
  prompt.

The `*` wildcard works mid-value, so `Edit(file_path:**/*.md)` (docs-only agent) or
`Bash(command:pytest hive/lib/**)` are both valid.

### Role-to-Deny-List

Hive runs multiple agent roles against the same repo. Param-level deny lists let each role
keep a tight blast radius. Recommended baselines:

| Role | Recommended deny-listed parameter patterns | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | `Edit(file_path:hive/lib/**/*)`, `Write(file_path:hive/lib/**/*)`, `Bash(command:git commit*)`, `Bash(command:git push*)` | Orchestrators dispatch and reconcile; they should not be hand-editing canonical runtime code or publishing. |
| `developer` | `Edit(file_path:.pHive/cycle-state/**/*)`, `Edit(file_path:**/.claude/settings.json)`, `Bash(command:git push*)`, `Write(file_path:**/.env*)` | Devs write code, not orchestration state or host permission config; push stays human-gated. |
| `reviewer` | `Edit(file_path:**)`, `Write(file_path:**)`, `Bash(command:git commit*)`, `Bash(command:git push*)` | Reviewers are read-and-comment only; deny all mutation so a review pass cannot alter the tree. |
| `planner` | `Edit(file_path:hive/lib/**/*)`, `Edit(file_path:src/**/*)`, `Bash(command:git commit*)`, `Bash(command:git push*)` | Planners produce `.pHive/` epics and stories, not implementation code or commits. |

Deny rules are evaluated before allow rules, so these patterns hold even when a broad
allowlist (`Bash(command:git *)`, `Edit(file_path:**)`) is also configured for convenience.

Note: as with the tool-name allowlists, `git commit` and `git push` are intentionally kept
**out of every allowlist and inside the deny lists above**. Mutating history and publishing
remain human-gated at the parameter level too — a `Bash(command:git *)` allow must always be
paired with explicit `Bash(command:git commit*)` / `Bash(command:git push*)` denies.

## Auto Mode Configuration Boundary

Project `.claude/settings.json` permissions and model preferences are advisory convenience
in auto mode. Claude Code auto-mode launch paths have not consistently honored project
settings or project-scoped plugin configuration, so no safety or correctness requirement may
depend only on those settings.

Behavior-critical Hive controls belong to tracked, plugin-owned surfaces or to an explicit
supported invocation path. In the Claude plugin these include the hooks registered in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the SessionStart version/effort gates and the PreToolUse agent
misuse gate), plus command and skill contracts shipped with the plugin. An unattended caller
must load the plugin explicitly, pass required invocation options explicitly, and fail closed
when the expected plugin gates are unavailable; copying an allowlist into project settings is
not a substitute.

The 2.16 compatibility audit found no tracked production `--auto` launcher outside the
excluded Hermes/lights-on integration. Therefore t-013 requires no production runtime change
for this release. Adding a non-Hermes auto-mode launcher reopens that disposition: its tests
must prove the supported invocation path loads the required plugin-owned gates without
relying on project settings.

## Command Pattern Rules for Step Files

Step files MUST follow these patterns. They are mandatory for all command templates.

| Do | Don't | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Single-line commands with literal values | Shell variable assignments (`F0="path"`) | Variables trigger "contains newlines" prompt |
| `&&` chaining for sequential commands | Multi-line with `\` continuation | `&&` is one logical command; `\` triggers approval |
| Use CLI tools (Frame0, git, build commands) | Use Write tool for managed files | Managed files need their CLI to register properly |
| Copy-paste from command templates | Construct commands from memory | Wrong flags cause silent failures + fallback to Write |
| Use `--` flag syntax | Positional args where flags exist | Flags are self-documenting and less error-prone |

### && chaining pattern (standard for Hive agents)

When multiple sequential commands are needed, chain them with `&&`:

```bash
# GOOD — one logical command, one permission prompt
./gradlew assembleDebug && adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk && adb shell am start -n com.app/.MainActivity

# BAD — three separate commands, three permission prompts
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.app/.MainActivity

# BAD — shell variable, triggers "contains newlines"
APK="app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk"
adb install -r "$APK"
```

This pattern works because `&&` chains are treated as a single command by Claude Code's permission system. Each command in the chain only runs if the previous one succeeded.

### bypassPermissions limitation

`bypassPermissions` on teammates does NOT suppress all prompt types. Specifically, "command contains newlines" prompts still fire for shell variable assignments. The `&&` chaining + literal values pattern avoids this entirely.

## Combining Allowlists

A project using all Hive workflows might have:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(cli-anything-frame-zero*)",
      "Bash(./gradlew *)",
      "Bash(npm test*)",
      "Bash(npm run *)",
      "Bash(maestro *)",
      "Bash(git status*)",
      "Bash(git log*)",
      "Bash(git diff*)",
      "Bash(git branch*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Note: `git commit`, `git push`, and destructive operations are intentionally NOT in the allowlist. Those should still require approval. The same holds at the parameter level — see the role-to-deny-list table above, where `Bash(command:git commit*)` and `Bash(command:git push*)` are deny-listed for every role rather than allowlisted.
