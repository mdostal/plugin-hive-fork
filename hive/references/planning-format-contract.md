# Planning Format Contract

Authoritative reference for allowed embedded content, image sourcing, diagram conventions,
sidecar generation, and terminal-degradation expectations across all Hive planning document
types.

**Living document.** Do not restructure when adding content — append to the appropriate
section. Update the doc-type table §1 to remove stub markers as each slice ships.

**Cross-referenced by:** `hive/agents/orchestrator.md`

## 1. Doc-Type Table

The canonical format and permitted embedded content for each planning document type.

| Doc type | Canonical format | Embedded content | Sidecar | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `design-discussion` | Markdown | `<figure>` image slots | `.html` generated on write | Wireframe slots filled from discovery protocol (§5); carries the epic concept illustration (§8) when visual mode is on |
| `structured-outline` | Markdown | `<figure>` optional; Mermaid dep map | `.html` generated on write | Figures optional; Mermaid dep map in §6 of structured-outline |
| `horizontal-plan` | Markdown | Mermaid layer diagrams | `.html` generated on write | Layer Map Diagram (§4 of horizontal-plan) uses `graph TD` per §3 |
| `vertical-plan` | Markdown | Mermaid slice diagrams | `.html` generated on write | Overlay Diagram (§3 of vertical-plan) uses `graph TD` per §3 |
| `PRD` | **HTML-primary** | Full HTML with sections, `<figure>`, Mermaid | `.md` sidecar (inverse direction) | Exception to markdown-canonical default; see §4 |

**Default:** Markdown is canonical for all doc types except PRD. When a doc type is not
listed above, assume markdown-canonical with no embedded HTML.

## 2. Image Source Policy

### Permitted sources

| Source | Usage | Path pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Approved wireframes | UI story `<figure>` slots in design-discussion | `state/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/approved.png` |
| Placeholder | When no approved wireframe exists | `<figure data-placeholder="...">` (see §5) |
| Brand assets | Brand-related planning docs only | `state/brand/` |
| Generated concept illustration | One per epic, on the design-discussion (see §8) | `.pHive/epics/{epic-id}/docs/concept-illustration.png` |

### Prohibited sources

- **External URLs** — no `<img src="https://...">` in planning docs. Planning documents
  are offline-readable artifacts; external image dependencies break reproducibility.
- **Embedded base64** — bloats token count. Use file references only.
- **Raw binary in git** — images must be generated artifacts, not committed source.
  Exceptions: (a) approved wireframes committed under `state/wireframes/` after design
  approval; (b) generated concept illustrations (§8), which are **gitignored** — referenced
  on-demand via `<figure data-src>`, never committed.

---

## 3. Mermaid Delimiter Convention

**This section (§3) is the single source for Mermaid graph conventions** — fenced-block
delimiters, orientation, the `accTitle`/`accDescr` title, and the `‖` parallel-marker
legend. Other skills (e.g. `skills/plan/SKILL.md` §"Diagram Format") point here rather
than restating these rules, so the convention lives in exactly one place.

Use standard fenced code blocks. No custom wrapper, no HTML embedding, no alternative
delimiters.

~~~markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
  S1[Story 1] --> S2[Story 2]
  S1 --> S3[Story 3]
```
~~~

**Do not** wrap Mermaid in `<div>`, `<pre>`, or any HTML container. The fenced block is
the canonical form — it degrades gracefully in terminal environments (see §6) and renders
in GitHub markdown and HTML sidecar viewers.

Skills that emit Mermaid must reference this document in their prose instruction:
> "Use standard fenced ` ```mermaid ``` ` blocks per `hive/references/planning-format-contract.md §3`."

### Accessibility and caption conventions

Every Mermaid block emitted by a planning skill must open with `accTitle` and `accDescr`
directives — they provide accessible names for screen readers and are used by the HTML
sidecar renderer to build the `<figcaption>` title:

~~~markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
accTitle: Layer Map Diagram
accDescr: Relationships between the architectural layers of the system
  S1[Story 1] --> S2[Story 2]
```
~~~

The HTML sidecar renderer wraps every pre-rendered diagram in
`<figure class="diagram"><figcaption>` using the nearest preceding section heading as
the caption title. When the source contains the `‖` parallel-marker glyph (used in
`/plan` dependency graphs — see `skills/plan/SKILL.md §18`), the renderer also appends a
legend: `‖ = parallel to its peers` — co-located in the `<figcaption>` per §6b Q6 of
the design discussion.

### Node ID convention

**Keep Mermaid node IDs matching story IDs for consistency.** In dependency graphs,
the Mermaid node ID for each story node must be the canonical story ID from the epic
YAML (e.g. `s1-auth-gate`, `s2-api-layer`). This makes the graph auditable alongside
the story list without a separate legend. Serial stories render as plain node IDs;
parallel-eligible stories append the `‖ <rationale>` annotation inside the label
string but keep the node ID unchanged (see step 18 of `skills/plan/SKILL.md` for the
annotated-label form `node-id["story-id ‖ <rationale>"]`).

---

## 4. Sidecar-HTML Generation Rule

**Markdown is canonical.** The `.md` file is the source of truth. The `.html` sibling is
a generated artifact — never the other way around, except for PRD (see below).

### Standard direction: markdown → HTML

1. Skill writes the `.md` file.
2. Skill invokes `python -m hive.lib.html_sidecar_gen` to produce the `.html` sibling at the same path.
3. The `.html` sidecar is **not committed to git by default**. It is generated on-demand.
   Add `*.html` (or the specific sidecar path pattern) to `.gitignore` for planning doc
   directories. The sidecar is a rendering convenience, not a versioned artifact.
4. If `hive.lib.html_sidecar_gen` is unavailable, the skill must log a warning and continue —
   the `.md` file is the deliverable; sidecar generation is best-effort.

### PRD exception: HTML-primary <!-- Added in S5.1 -->

PRD is the **only** document type where HTML is canonical. The `.md` sidecar is the
inverse direction — a stripped, grep-compatible fallback, not the source.

1. Skill writes the `.html` file first. The HTML document is a full `<!DOCTYPE html>`
   page with: a `<nav>` table of contents, named `<section id="...">` blocks per PRD
   section, inline `<div class="mermaid">` blocks (auto-initialized via Mermaid CDN on
   load), and `<figure>` elements following the wireframe discovery protocol (§5).
2. Skill invokes `generate_markdown_sidecar(html_path)` from `hive.lib.html_sidecar_gen` to
   produce the `.md` sibling at the same path.
3. The `.md` sidecar strips HTML scaffolding (head, nav, script, wrapper divs) and
   converts block elements to markdown equivalents. `<figure>` blocks are preserved
   as-is so `data-placeholder` attributes remain visible in terminal / grep output.
4. Neither file is hand-edited after generation. The HTML is the deliverable; the `.md`
   is a rendering convenience for terminal environments.
5. Both files are committed to git for PRDs (unlike `.html` sidecars for other doc types,
   which are generated on-demand and gitignored).

**Canonical paths:**
- HTML: `.pHive/epics/{epic-id}/docs/prd.html`
- Sidecar: `.pHive/epics/{epic-id}/docs/prd.md`

## 5. Wireframe Discovery Protocol

Before writing `<figure>` slots in any planning document, the authoring agent must check
for approved wireframes. This protocol prevents stale placeholder slots from shipping
when wireframe artifacts already exist.

### Step 1 — Check for approved wireframes

Look for approved wireframe files in:

~~~
state/wireframes/{epic-id}/
~~~

Search for files matching `{story-id}/approved.png` or `{story-id}/v*.png`. The
`approved.png` filename indicates a wireframe that has passed the design approval
touchpoint (see `hive/references/wireframe-protocol.md`).

### Step 2a — Wireframe found: use image reference

~~~html
<figure>
  <img src="../../../../state/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/approved.png"
       alt="{descriptive alt text}">
  <figcaption>{caption describing the wireframe context}</figcaption>
</figure>
~~~

Use a path relative to the planning document's location. The `../../../../` prefix above
walks up from the doc dir (`.pHive/epics/{epic-id}/docs/`) to the repo root, where
`state/wireframes/` lives. Confirm the file exists before writing the reference — a broken
`<img src>` is worse than a placeholder.

### Step 2b — Wireframe absent: use data-placeholder

Do **not** block document writing on wireframe availability. Use a placeholder slot:

~~~html
<figure data-placeholder="{description of expected wireframe content}">
</figure>
~~~

The `data-placeholder` attribute is the canonical signal that this image slot is unfilled.
Sidecar generators, reviewers, and future agents use it to identify slots pending wireframe
approval. Do not use empty `<figure>` or comments — the attribute is required.

### Step 3 — One check per document write

Run the check once per document write, not per `<figure>` slot. If the epic directory
does not exist at all, all slots in the document use placeholders. Do not make per-slot
filesystem calls.

## 6. Terminal-Degradation Expectations

Planning documents must remain useful in terminal environments where HTML and Mermaid do
not render visually.

| Element | Terminal rendering | Usability | Grep-compatible |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<figure>` with `<img>` | Visible HTML tag block, image not displayed | Readable — tag identifies where image would appear | Yes |
| `<figure data-placeholder="...">` | Visible HTML tag with attribute text | Readable — placeholder text describes expected content | Yes |
| ` ```mermaid ``` ` fences | Plain-text code block (Mermaid source) | Readable — graph structure visible as text | Yes |
| `.html` sidecar | Not rendered; separate file | No degradation — markdown canonical is the terminal artifact | N/A |
| PRD `.html` | Not rendered | Use `.md` sidecar for terminal reading | `.md` sidecar greppable |

**Invariant:** A planning document must always be readable in a plain-text terminal viewer.
If an element fails this test, it must either degrade gracefully (as above) or be
prohibited.

**Known limitation:** Mermaid diagrams are not visually rendered in terminal-only
environments. The fenced code block form is readable as a dependency graph (nodes and
arrows are plain text), but not visually equivalent to a rendered diagram. This is an
accepted limitation documented here; out of scope for S1 remediation.

---

## 7. Visual Planning Mode <!-- Added in hive-composability-design follow-up -->

Visual planning — HTML sidecar generation (§4), Mermaid diagrams (§3), `<figure>` image
slots (§5), and the concept illustration (§8) — is **on by default**. It is a rendering
layer over markdown-canonical docs; turning it off never changes which file is the source
of truth.

**Resolution (flag overrides config, config overrides default):**

1. `--no-visual` flag on the `/plan` invocation → visual planning OFF for that run.
2. Else `planning.visual: false` in root-resolved `hive.config.yaml` → OFF.
3. Else → ON (absent config key means on).

Store the resolved boolean as `${visual_planning}` on the planning context.

**What OFF suppresses:**

- HTML sidecar generation for markdown-canonical doc types (§4 standard direction). The
  `.md` file is still written — it is the deliverable.
- The concept illustration step (§8).

**What OFF does NOT change:**

- Mermaid fenced blocks (§3) stay in the markdown — they degrade to readable text (§6) and
  cost nothing extra to emit.
- `<figure>` slots and the wireframe discovery protocol (§5) — these are markdown content,
  not a rendering pass.
- **PRD stays HTML-primary (§4 exception).** PRD's canonical form is HTML; `--no-visual`
  does not strip it. The PRD `.md` sidecar is still generated (it is the grep fallback).
  `--no-visual` only suppresses the concept illustration for a PRD-bearing run.

### 7.1 Sidecar Retention (`sidecar_retention`)

Controls whether planning HTML sidecars are committed to git or left transient.

**Values:**

| Value | Behavior | Recommended for |
|---|---|---|
| `committed` | Allowlists `*.html` + `index.html` under the epic docs dir in `.gitignore` | Group / shared projects — committed sidecars make the plan browsable without a re-run |
| `transient` | Ignores `*.html` and `index.html` under the epic; regenerate on demand | Solo projects — committed HTML is clutter when only one person needs the plan |
| `commit-docs-only` | Allowlists story doc sidecars; excludes `index.html` and PNGs | Docs-heavy projects that want per-story sidecars but not the top-level index or illustrations |

**Resolution precedence (first match wins):**

1. Per-epic answer to the `/plan` retention question (step 14c).
2. `planning.sidecar_retention` in root-resolved `hive.config.yaml`.
3. Shipped default: `committed`.

**Persistence:** The resolved value is written to `epic.yaml` as `sidecar_retention: <value>` (immediately after `version_bump:`). On re-plan the field is updated in place.

**`.gitignore` policy:** `/plan` step 15 drives the repo root `.gitignore` based on the resolved value immediately after writing `epic.yaml`. See `skills/plan/SKILL.md` step 15 for the exact block shapes per value.

**Config key:** `planning.sidecar_retention` in `hive.config.yaml` (schema version 1.2+). Absent key falls through to the `committed` default.

## 8. Concept Illustration <!-- Added in hive-composability-design follow-up -->

At the end of planning, when `${visual_planning}` is ON, `/plan` generates **one**
AI illustration per epic depicting what the planned change "looks like" — part signal
(how the agent sized up the work), part delight. This is the only generated raster in the
planning flow.

**Generation rule:**

1. Gate: run only when `${visual_planning}` is ON **and** `--lite` is not active (`--lite`
   is token-economy; the illustration is the most expensive step, so lite skips it).
2. Build a prompt from the finalized planning context (epic title + design-discussion goal +
   scale assessment + the principal slices/changes). Describe a conceptual scene or
   diagram, not a literal UI.
3. Invoke the `openai-image` MCP tool `generate_image` with that prompt, `output_dir` set
   to the epic docs dir, and `output_prefix: concept`. Save to
   `.pHive/epics/{epic-id}/docs/concept-illustration.png`.
4. Embed it on the **design-discussion** (the always-present primary artifact) as a
   trailing section, then regenerate that doc's `.html` sidecar:

   ~~~html
   <figure data-src="concept-illustration.png" data-alt="Concept illustration of the planned change">
   </figure>
   ~~~

5. **Non-blocking, best-effort.** If the MCP tool is unavailable, `OPENAI_API_KEY` is
   missing, or the call errors (e.g. `403` verified-org requirement), propagate the exact
   error message verbatim as a warning, embed a `data-placeholder` figure instead, and
   continue. A failed illustration is never a failed plan.
6. The PNG is **gitignored** (`.pHive/epics/**/docs/*.png`) — generated on-demand, not
   committed, consistent with §2.

## Extension Notes

When adding sections in future D-expansion slices:

- Append to the relevant section (e.g., add PRD details to §4 when S5 ships).
- Do not restructure the document. Section numbers are stable references.
- Update the doc-type table §1 to remove `(S5+)` stubs as each slice ships.
- Each added section should note its originating slice (e.g., `<!-- Added in S5.x -->`).

<!-- S4.3 shipped: H/V and structured-outline Mermaid/figure support and sidecar generation added. (S4+) stubs removed from doc-type table. -->
