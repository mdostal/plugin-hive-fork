# Dispatch Parity Matrix

Produced by Slice 6 of substrate-coverage-and-test-cleanup; canonical reference for what's wired across substrates. Each cell carries either a relative path to the active mode-atom skill, the marker `inline` for default-path dispatch through the orchestrator skill itself, or `N/A — reasoning` when the cell has no shipped substrate.

## Matrix

| Orchestrator | default | multica | cc-workflows |
|---|---|---|---|
| plan | inline | skills/hive/skills/plan-mode-multica/SKILL.md | skills/hive/skills/plan-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md |
| execute | inline | skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-multica/SKILL.md | skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md |
| test | inline | skills/hive/skills/test-mode-multica/SKILL.md | skills/hive/skills/test-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md |
| design | inline | skills/hive/skills/design-mode-multica/SKILL.md | skills/hive/skills/design-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md |
| design-review | inline | skills/hive/skills/design-review-mode-multica/SKILL.md | skills/hive/skills/design-review-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md |
| review | inline | skills/hive/skills/review-mode-multica/SKILL.md | skills/hive/skills/review-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md |

The `inline` marker means the default dispatch path runs inside the top-level orchestrator skill itself (e.g., `skills/plan/SKILL.md`) — no separate mode-atom skill file exists for the default substrate.

## Future substrate

Placeholder columns for substrates not yet shipped. New substrates land here as `not-shipped` until the full 6-row atom set is available and CI-verified.

| Orchestrator | sandcastle | gh-actions-legacy |
|---|---|---|
| plan | not-shipped — see execution.runtime: sandcastle (Epic D) | not-shipped — superseded by Multica |
| execute | not-shipped — see skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-sandcastle/SKILL.md (Epic D candidate) | not-shipped — superseded by Multica |
| test | not-shipped — see execution.runtime: sandcastle (Epic D) | not-shipped — superseded by Multica |
| design | not-shipped — see execution.runtime: sandcastle (Epic D) | not-shipped — superseded by Multica |
| design-review | not-shipped — see execution.runtime: sandcastle (Epic D) | not-shipped — superseded by Multica |
| review | not-shipped — see execution.runtime: sandcastle (Epic D) | not-shipped — superseded by Multica |

Note: `execute-mode-sandcastle/SKILL.md` exists as an Epic D candidate but the full sandcastle substrate row (all 6 orchestrators) has not shipped. It is listed here as `not-shipped` to keep the matrix forward-extensible.

## Manifest Source (process-manifest registry)

Each shipped orchestrator has a corresponding **process manifest** in `hive/manifests/`. The
manifest is the executor-neutral representation of the workflow — its steps, gates, and
adapters — expressed as data that any executor (CC plugin, Codex, direct API, hive-dag)
can consume. The matrix above lists the CC adapter paths as before; the table below adds
the manifest-source column.

| Orchestrator | Manifest |
|---|---|
| plan | hive/manifests/plan.process.yaml |

The `adapters` section of each manifest maps substrate keys to the concrete CC skill or
DAG workflow file listed in the matrix. For example, `plan.process.yaml`
`adapters.multica.skill` resolves to the same path as the multica cell above. The CC
plugin is thus the **reference adapter** that reads a manifest and materialises today's
skill/hook dispatch — it is not the control plane itself.

Follow-on: the remaining five orchestrators (execute / test / design / design-review /
review) ship their manifests in subsequent stories. Until then, only `plan` appears here.

Verification: `node hive/scripts/verify-dispatch-parity.mjs` also checks that every
manifest path cited in this table exists on disk and is git-tracked.

## Verification

Run `node hive/scripts/verify-dispatch-parity.mjs` from repo root. Exit 0 = all cited paths resolve on disk AND `git ls-files` confirms tracking. Exit 1 = at least one path missing/untracked; checker prints the failing rows. CI runs this on every PR; PRs that move/remove a cited path fail until the matrix is updated.

Pass `--no-bump` to skip the automatic date-stamp update on the `## Last verified:` line.

## Config-knob dispatch impact (config-reference-refresh)

The Bucket A config knobs documented in `hive/references/configuration.md` (see
s1-configuration-md-refresh) are explanatory only here — they do not alter the
substrate matrix above and get no matrix row, since the matrix's columns are
substrates (default/multica/cc-workflows), not config keys.

- **`agent_backends.fallback_model`** (distinct from CC-native `fallbackModel`;
  see configuration.md) — affects agent-backend resolution at dispatch time,
  across all three substrate columns equally (default, multica, cc-workflows);
  it does not change which mode-atom file a substrate dispatches to, only
  which model backend answers once dispatch has already resolved.
- **`/config key=value`** — a Claude Code operator shortcut for editing
  `settings.json` (CC v2.1.181+). It is not Hive dynamic config and does not
  touch `hive.config.yaml`, so it affects none of the dispatch paths in this
  matrix.
- **`anthropicAws` (aspirational stub)** — proposed/not-yet-implemented; no
  provider reader, credential/security review, or parse/precedence tests exist
  yet. It affects none of the dispatch paths in this matrix today.
