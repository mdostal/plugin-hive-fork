# Workflow Definition Schema

Workflows are YAML files that define a sequence of steps with agent assignments, dependencies, and data flow.

## Structure

```yaml
name: workflow-name          # lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens
description: What it does    # optional
version: "1.0.0"             # semver
methodology: classic         # optional: classic, tdd, bdd, fdd

steps:
  - id: step-name            # unique within workflow, lowercase
    agent: researcher         # agent persona to use (matches agents/ filename)
    task: >                   # task description for the agent (fallback if no step_file)
      What the agent should do.
    step_file: workflows/steps/{name}/step-01-{name}.md  # optional: path to step file
    depends_on:               # optional: step IDs that must complete first
      - previous-step
    inputs:                   # optional: data from previous steps
      - name: param-name
        source: step_output   # literal, step_output, or context
        step_id: previous-step
        output_name: output-name
    outputs:                  # optional: named outputs for downstream steps
      - name: result
        type: string          # string, json, or artifact_ref
    optional: false           # if true, workflow continues even if step fails
    timeout_ms: 600000        # max duration (1s to 1hr)
```

### Step Files

The `step_file` field points to a self-contained instruction file that replaces the inline `task` description. When `step_file` is present, the orchestrator loads the file and passes it to the agent as the primary procedure — the `task` field becomes a fallback summary.

Step files provide robust guardrails: mandatory execution rules, context boundaries, command templates, success metrics, failure modes, and next-step gating. See `references/step-file-schema.md` for the full schema.

**Precedence:** `step_file` > `task`. If both are present, the step file is authoritative.

**Three-layer context model:** When using step files, the agent receives:
1. **Agent persona** (from `agents/{agent}.md`) — WHO: identity, capabilities, quality standards
2. **Step file** (from `step_file` path) — HOW: exact procedure, execution rules, gating
3. **Story spec** (from execution context) — WHAT: the specific feature or task

Step files live at `hive/workflows/steps/{workflow-name}/step-{NN}-{kebab-name}.md`.

## Dependency Rules

- Steps without `depends_on` can run immediately (or in parallel if agent teams are available)
- Steps with `depends_on` wait until all listed steps complete
- Circular dependencies are invalid
- If an optional step fails, downstream steps that depend on it receive null inputs

## Input Sources

| Source | Required Fields | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `literal` | `value` | Hardcoded string value |
| `step_output` | `step_id`, `output_name` | Output from a previous step (typed point-to-point binding) |
| `context` | `context_key` | Value from workflow execution context |
| `reference` | `reference_pointer` | **Additive lean-flow layer.** Content read lazily from a filesystem pointer at resolution time. See [Reference-Passing](#reference-passing-source-reference). |

## Output Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `string` | Plain text output |
| `json` | Structured JSON data |
| `artifact_ref` | Reference to a file produced by the step |

## Conditional Skip (`skip_when`)

Steps may declare a `skip_when` predicate that suppresses execution when true. The predicate is a free-form string evaluated by the orchestrator against the workflow execution context (story spec, prior step outputs, hive.config.yaml).

```yaml
steps:
  - id: research
    agent: researcher
    skip_when: "story.complexity == 'low'"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `skip_when` | string | null | Predicate; when true the step is skipped and downstream `optional` inputs receive null |

When a step is skipped, downstream steps that bind to its outputs via per-input `optional: true` receive `null` and proceed; bindings without `optional: true` halt the dependent step.

## Output Gate (`gate`)

Steps may declare a `gate` assertion that the step's outputs must satisfy before downstream steps run. The gate text is a free-form predicate evaluated against the step's output dict.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: test
    agent: tester
    outputs:
      - name: test_artifacts
        type: artifact_ref
    gate: "test_artifacts must not be empty"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `gate` | string | null | Predicate over step outputs; failure halts the workflow with a gate-rejection record |

Gates are distinct from the `retry` block: a gate failure is a hard halt at the step's output boundary, while `retry` governs how many times a step may be re-attempted before that gate is consulted.

## Gate Retry Configuration

Steps can define retry behavior for when quality gates fail. Add a `retry` block to any step:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: review
    agent: reviewer
    task: >
      Review the implementation...
    retry:
      max_attempts: 2          # total attempts (1 = no retry, 2 = one retry)
      feedback_injection: true  # feed gate findings into retry prompt
      escalate_after: 2         # escalate to human after N failures
```

### Retry Flow

```
for each attempt up to max_attempts:
  output = executeStep(prompt + gateFeedback)
  gate = evaluateGate(output)
  if gate.passed: break
  gateFeedback = gate.findings  // inject into next attempt
if not passed after all attempts:
  if escalate_after reached: escalate to human
  elif step.optional: skip with warning
  else: halt story with failed status
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_attempts` | int | 1 | Total execution attempts (1 = no retry) |
| `feedback_injection` | bool | true | Feed gate findings into retry prompt |
| `escalate_after` | int | max_attempts | Escalate to human after N failures |

### When to Use

- **Review steps** — reviewer returns `needs_revision` → feed findings to developer → retry
- **Test steps** — tests fail → feed failure output to developer → retry implementation
- **Validation steps** — coverage gaps found → feed gaps to test author → retry

Steps without a `retry` block default to `max_attempts: 1` (no retry).

## Per-Step Tool Gating (`tools`, `disallowed_tools`)

Steps may narrow or override the agent persona's default tool grant via two per-step fields:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: implement
    agent: developer
    tools: ["Read", "Edit", "Bash(git *)"]
    disallowed_tools: ["Write"]
```

### Composition policy: `pure_override_with_surface_when_overrides`

Cycle-state composition rationale (`security:plan-audit` lock):

> "situation dictates which tools are used; step-author has most specific context; trust step-level authority but surface/log when step overrides persona for security observability."

- **`tools:`** — when set, **REPLACES** the persona default tool list entirely. NOT a merge. The step-author's intent supersedes the persona baseline because the step has the most specific context.
- **`disallowed_tools:`** — when set, subtracts from the active set. If `tools:` is also set, subtraction runs against `tools:`; otherwise against the persona default.
- **Neither set** — persona defaults pass through unchanged. No audit event.

### Audit-event contract

Every override path emits one `tool_gating_overridden` event via the executor telemetry channel. Event payload:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `persona_default_tools` | list[str] | Pre-override baseline |
| `effective_tools` | list[str] | Post-composition tool list |
| `step_override_tools` | list[str] | Present iff `tools:` was set |
| `step_disallowed_tools` | list[str] | Present iff `disallowed_tools:` was set |
| `persona_id` | str | Present iff resolved at policy time |

Standard executor event envelope (`run_id`, `step_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp`) is added by the telemetry layer. See `executor-event-schema.md` for the envelope contract.

### Allow-list — `escalatable_tools.yaml` (second factor)

`hive/lib/dag_executor/executor/escalatable_tools.yaml` is the maintainer-controlled second factor on top of the audit event. Without it, a workflow YAML edit could silently grant any tool. With it, an unlisted tool causes `ToolNotEscalatableError` at policy resolution.

| Section | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `always_grantable` | Low-blast tools (Read, Grep, Glob, LS) any step may grant |
| `escalatable` | High-blast tools (Bash, Write, Edit, codex, cmux) — listed = allowed; unlisted = `ToolNotEscalatableError` |
| `persona_deny.<tool>` | Personas that may **never** receive `<tool>` via override (e.g. `codex` is denied to `reviewer`, `peer-validator`, `security-reviewer` so verifier isolation holds) — violation raises `BackendIsolationViolationError` |

A step that *narrows* a tool already in the persona default (`Bash(git *)` against persona `Bash`) is treated as a constraint, not a grant — the allow-list is not consulted.

### Platform check (Risk #11)

Tools `codex` and `cmux` are macOS-only by upstream constraint. When a step grants either on a non-Darwin platform, `compose_tool_policy` raises `PlatformIncompatibilityError`. **No silent fallback** — surfacing the mismatch at policy resolution time prevents cryptic agent-runtime confusion.

## Pause / Approve Gates (`node_type: pause`)

A `node_type: pause` step SUSPENDS the run, persists a per-run HMAC signing key (mode `0600`), emits a signed resume token to telemetry, and waits for an external sentinel. Operators (or upstream automation) approve or reject by writing a sentinel file under `.pHive/runs/{run_id}/pause/`.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: human_approval
    node_type: pause
    timeout_ms: 86400000   # optional; default = no user timeout
    depends_on: [pre_pause]
```

### Sentinel files

| Path | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `.pHive/runs/{run_id}/pause/{node_id}.approve` | Resume the workflow. Sentinel body MUST contain the resume token issued at suspend time. |
| `.pHive/runs/{run_id}/pause/{node_id}.reject` | Fail the workflow. Sentinel body MUST contain the token; an optional reason follows after a blank line. |

The pause directory is created with mode `0700`. The signing key file (`.signing_key`) is written with mode `0600` and never leaves the local machine.

### Token format

```
<base64url(payload_json)>.<hex_hmac_sha256>
```

Payload: `{"run_id": "...", "node_id": "...", "timestamp": "..."}`. The token is bound to BOTH `run_id` AND `node_id` — a token from one run cannot resume another, and a token from one pause node cannot resume a sibling node within the same run (Risk #10 mitigation). Sentinel filenames alone NEVER honor the pause: `signal.py` reads the body and verifies the signature against the per-run key BEFORE returning. An invalid token raises `PauseSignalForgedError`; the polling loop continues so an attacker cannot force success by writing a junk sentinel.

### Timeout & security floor

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `timeout_ms` set | Wait up to `min(timeout_ms / 1000, hard_ceiling)` seconds. |
| `timeout_ms` omitted | Wait up to `hard_ceiling` seconds (default **30 days**). |

The hard ceiling is a security floor — a forgotten "no timeout" pause cannot hold an open run-state, worktree, and signing key indefinitely (security:plan-audit finding #3).

### State transitions

| Trigger | run_state status | Telemetry event |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Pause node enters handler | `RUNNING` → `SUSPENDED` (via `mark_suspended`) | `pause_suspended` (payload includes the resume token) |
| Approve sentinel verified | `SUSPENDED` → `RUNNING` (via resume) | `pause_resumed` |
| Reject sentinel verified | `SUSPENDED` → `FAILED` (via `mark_failed`) | `pause_rejected` (payload carries the reason) |
| Timeout elapsed | `SUSPENDED` → `FAILED` (via `mark_failed`) | `pause_timeout` |

## Conditional User Gates (`node_type: user_gate`)

A `node_type: user_gate` step is a human review checkpoint with an optional
machine predicate. It auto-passes only when `auto_pass_when` evaluates true;
otherwise it suspends with the same signed sentinel mechanism as
`node_type: pause`.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: hv-gate
    agent: technical-writer
    node_type: user_gate
    auto_pass_when: "$hv.output.first_run == false && $hv.output.confidence >= 80"
    depends_on:
      - hv
    timeout_ms: 1800000
```

### `auto_pass_when` grammar

`auto_pass_when` uses the existing strict predicate grammar. No new operators
or functions are introduced for user gates.

```ebnf
auto_pass_when = predicate ;
predicate      = comparison , { ( "&&" | "||" ) , comparison } ;
comparison     = dotpath , operator , literal ;
dotpath        = "$" , step_id , ".output." , output_name ;
operator       = "==" | "!=" | ">=" | ">" | "<=" | "<" ;
literal        = string | number | boolean ;
boolean        = "true" | "false" ;
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `node_type` | string | `agent` | Set to `user_gate` for a conditional human gate. |
| `auto_pass_when` | string | null | Predicate over prior node outputs. If true, the gate proceeds without sentinel files. If false or absent, the gate suspends. |
| `timeout_ms` | int | pause hard ceiling | Maximum wait for a human approve/reject sentinel, capped by the pause security ceiling. |

Absent-dotpath behavior is fail-closed: when a predicate references a missing
output such as `$hv.output.confidence`, the predicate evaluates false and the
gate halts. Missing confidence, missing open-questions counts, and missing
first-run signals never auto-pass.

### Actor contract

The `.approve` and `.reject` sentinels MUST be written by a human reviewer.
CI automation, agent loops, scheduled jobs, and other automated pipelines are
explicitly excluded from writing user-gate sentinels. The executor verifies the
sentinel token, but it cannot prove who wrote the file; the human-only rule is
an operational contract.

### Binding scope

The shipped binding is filesystem-only: sentinel files live under the local
`.pHive/runs/{run_id}/pause/` tree or the configured run-state root. A Multica
sentinel bridge is a named precondition before deploying `user_gate` approval
semantics through a remote Multica UI or API surface.

This preserves the gate-ownership invariant from `/plan`: external execution
substrates may produce artifacts, but user review and sign-off remains owned by
the orchestrator/operator boundary.

## Bounded Converge-Loop (`node_type: loop`)

`LOOP` is an **authoring-time keyword, not a runtime node type.** A workflow
author writes `node_type: loop` with a `loop_config`, but the load-time
expander (`hive/lib/dag_executor/graph/unroll.py`, `expand_loops`, called from
`load_workflow`) rewrites it into a pure acyclic DAG of deterministic
round-copy nodes (`<node>__r1 .. __rN`) **before** the executor ever sees it.
After loading, the graph contains **zero** `LOOP`-type nodes; the executor
walker has no loop primitive and never iterates anything at runtime — it just
walks a plain DAG. See [`loop-unroll-migration.md`](loop-unroll-migration.md)
for the full rationale and migration history (this section previously
described the retired runtime model, where the executor intercepted LOOP
nodes and iterated the sub-graph in place at execution time — that model no
longer exists).

**Opt-in.** Only a LOOP node whose `loop_config.feature` is set is expanded by
`expand_loops`; a LOOP with no `feature` is left untouched (an
authoring-only/not-yet-activated loop). `feature` maps to `loops.<feature>`
in `hive.config.yaml` (`enabled` + `max_rounds`, resolved via
`hive.lib.config.resolve_loop_config`); an env var
(`HIVE_LOOPS_<FEATURE>_ENABLED` / `HIVE_LOOPS_<FEATURE>_MAX_ROUNDS`) overrides
the config value. Disabled, or `max_rounds == 1`, collapses to a single
degenerate pass — the body runs once, in the same order as if there were no
loop at all (see the "declared ids" caveat in
[`workflow-authoring.md`](workflow-authoring.md)).

```yaml
steps:
  # Loop-body members: any node whose `sub_graph:` matches the LOOP node's
  # loop_config.sub_graph. Members are the loop's iterated body — the
  # expander deletes their bare declared ids from the graph and replaces
  # them with round-copy ids (fix-cycle-implement -> fix-cycle-implement__r1,
  # __r2, ...); they are never scheduled at the top level under their bare id.
  - id: fix-cycle-implement
    agent: developer
    sub_graph: review-fix-cycle
    depends_on: [review]

  - id: fix-cycle-review
    agent: reviewer
    sub_graph: review-fix-cycle
    depends_on: [fix-cycle-implement]
    outputs:
      - name: review_passed       # BOOLEAN convergence signal — see note below
        type: json

  - id: review-converge-loop
    node_type: loop
    loop_config:
      feature: review_converge                  # opt-in tag -> loops.review_converge
      sub_graph: review-fix-cycle                # which members to iterate
      convergence_signal: review_passed          # boolean signal a body node emits
      gate_predicate: "review_verdict not equals needs_revision"  # legacy prose fallback
      max_rounds: 3
    depends_on: [review]
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `node_type` | string | `agent` | Set to `loop` for a bounded converge-loop. |
| `loop_config.sub_graph` | string | — | Required, non-empty. Identifies the loop body: every node whose `sub_graph:` equals this value. |
| `loop_config.feature` | string | null | Opt-in tag. A LOOP with no `feature` is left unexpanded (authoring-only); `expand_loops` only unrolls feature-tagged loops. A feature-tagged loop with zero matching body nodes is a **load-time error** (`GraphLoadError`) — it can never be unrolled and would otherwise survive to the walker as a raw LOOP node. |
| `loop_config.convergence_signal` | string | null | Name of a boolean `type: json` output a body node produces. When set, the expander emits a grammar-legal `skip_when` OR-chain (`$<producer>__r{j}.output.<signal> == true` over all prior rounds) that short-circuits later rounds once the signal fires. Validated at load time: a declared `convergence_signal` with no producing body node is a `GraphLoadError`. |
| `loop_config.gate_predicate` | string | — | Required, non-empty. Legacy prose fallback used only when `convergence_signal` is absent or has no producer — in that case it is copied verbatim into `skip_when`, which the strict predicate grammar cannot parse (no string-literal support), so it fail-closes to "never skip" (every round runs to `max_rounds`). Prefer `convergence_signal` for a functioning early-exit. |
| `loop_config.max_rounds` | int | — | Required positive integer. Hard iteration ceiling (prevents non-termination). Validated at graph-parse time (`LoopConfigError`). |
| `sub_graph` (on a member node) | string | null | Loop-body membership tag. Additive; absent on all non-loop nodes. Cleared on the emitted round copies (they are ordinary top-level nodes after expansion). |

**Convergence signal grammar.** `convergence_signal` must name a boolean
(`type: json`) output — the expander only ever emits `== true` dotpath
comparisons for it. The strict predicate grammar has **no string literals**
(see [`predicate-grammar.md`](./predicate-grammar.md)), so a *converging* loop
must gate on a boolean or numeric signal field, never a string verdict.
`development.classic.workflow.yaml`'s `review-converge-loop` and
`test-swarm.workflow.yaml`'s `swarm-rounds-loop` both declare
`convergence_signal` alongside a human-readable `gate_predicate` fallback
string (`review_verdict not equals needs_revision`, `coverage satisfied`) —
the fallback is legacy/unused for skip purposes once `convergence_signal` has
a producer; it exists for backward-compat with loops that predate s3
(convergence-signal support) and have not yet been given one.

**Multi-exit loops.** Post-loop nodes are rewired to depend on ALL of the
last round's body exit nodes (nodes no other body node depends on). A loop
body with more than one exit, combined with a declared `convergence_signal`
and `max_rounds > 1`, is rejected at load time (`GraphLoadError`) — early
convergence can leave every last-round exit SKIPPED, which can cause a
downstream multi-upstream join to be SKIPPED-not-evaluated instead of
blocking (see pr20-fable-review finding S3). Keep loop bodies single-exit, or
add a trivial join step inside the `sub_graph` that unifies multiple internal
branches into one exit.

## Reference-Passing (`source: reference`)

An **additive** lean-flow layer alongside the typed point-to-point
`step_output` binding (the primary, audited wiring, which is unchanged). A node
may write an output to a filesystem **pointer** — a plain path relative to the
run working directory — and a downstream node may declare a `source: reference`
binding that resolves the pointer **lazily**, reading the content at
input-resolution time.

```yaml
  - id: consumer
    agent: developer
    inputs:
      - name: review_notes
        source: reference
        reference_pointer: refs/review.md   # path relative to run working dir
```

- **Pointer format:** filesystem path relative to the run working directory
  (`run_working_dir` in the run context; absolute paths are honored as-is).
- **Lazy resolution:** the pointer is read when the downstream node's inputs are
  resolved, not when the producer runs.
- **Missing pointer:** raises a clear `MissingReferenceError` naming the pointer
  at resolution time — never a silent `None`.
- **No SDK dependency:** the concept (filesystem pointer + lazy resolution) is
  adopted with the Python standard library only; there is no Open-Prose SDK
  import. Producing helpers live in `hive/lib/dag_executor/executor/reference.py`
  (`write_reference` / `read_reference`).

The typed `step_output` contract remains the primary wiring and the audit
surface; `reference` is opt-in for nodes that want to pass large or
loosely-typed outputs without threading them through a typed binding.

## Scheduler Overrides (`under_scheduler`)

Steps that normally require an interactive pause may declare an `under_scheduler` block to define non-interactive behavior when the workflow is running in scheduler context.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: plan-approval
    node_type: pause
    under_scheduler:
      auto_approve: true
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `under_scheduler.auto_approve` | bool | null | Scheduler-context override for a pause step: `true` auto-passes the step without dispatching the pause handler; `false` fails closed with an error instead of blocking on a non-interactive pause. |

Interactive runs ignore `under_scheduler` and dispatch the pause step normally. The key is step-level and generalizable to any future workflow whose interactive gate needs explicit scheduler behavior.

## Predicate Routing (`when:`)

Per-step `when:` is a strict-Archon predicate evaluated against the materialised output graph of upstream steps before dispatch. When the predicate evaluates False (or fails closed), the step is skipped — the walker emits `predicate_evaluated` (with the result) and `node_skipped` (with `reason: when_predicate_false`).

```yaml
steps:
  - id: triage
    agent: researcher
    outputs:
      - name: metric_signal
        type: json

  - id: deep-dive
    agent: researcher
    depends_on: [triage]
    when: "$triage.output.metric_signal == true"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `when` | string | null | Strict-Archon predicate; False or fail-closed skips the step. Distinct from `skip_when` (which gates on workflow context). |

The grammar — operators, fail-closed semantics, change_verdict / cycle_verdict disambiguation, and the cultural lock that grammar additions require an epic — is documented in [`predicate-grammar.md`](./predicate-grammar.md). Workflow authors should read that doc before adding any `when:` predicate.

## Multi-Upstream Joins (`trigger_rule`)

Steps with multiple `depends_on` entries (multi-upstream joins) are gated by a single trigger-rule policy:

| Trigger rule | Behaviour |
|--------------|-----------|
| `none_failed_min_one_success` (default and only) | RUN iff at least one upstream completed; SKIP otherwise. Failed upstreams convert to SKIP for the candidate node — failure does NOT cascade as failure. |

The policy name is intentionally explicit and fixed; alternative trigger rules (`all_success`, `any_success`, `always`, `one_failed`) are NOT supported. Adding one requires an epic — see [`predicate-grammar.md`](./predicate-grammar.md).

Single-upstream nodes do not pass through the trigger-rule layer — the per-input `optional: true` semantics from [Conditional Skip](#conditional-skip-skip_when) and [Input Sources](#input-sources) preserve the legacy contract: an upstream optional failure surfaces as `None` on the downstream binding rather than skipping the downstream.

## Executor Cutover — Additive + Registry-Gated

The Hive DAG executor (`hive.lib.dag_executor`) is a deterministic alternative to the orchestrator-narrated execution path. Its rollout is **additive**: graduating a workflow to the executor does not break, change, or version the workflow YAML schema. The same workflow file runs unchanged under either path; the executor lights up the structured `output_format` contracts (hde-3b) and `when:` predicates (hde-3a) when present, and falls back to prose-output equivalents otherwise.

Cutover gating is per-consumer and per-workflow:

- **Consumer flag:** `.pHive/hive.config.yaml` (consumer-side, NOT shipped) carries `executor: hive-dag` and `executor_default: off|on`. Default OFF.
- **Graduation registry:** `.pHive/runtime/executor-graduated-workflows.yaml` lists the workflow names that have been graduated to the executor. A workflow runs through the executor only when the consumer flag is on AND the workflow appears in the registry.
- **Routing point:** `skills/execute/SKILL.md` step 5pre is the single dispatch point. See `hive/lib/dag_executor/__init__.py` for the `executor_enabled_for(workflow_name)` reader.

Workflow authors do not need to schema-version their files when graduating. Existing workflows that pass spine-parity tests under the executor are graduation candidates.

### Authoring forward — defaults for new workflows

New workflow authors should default to executor-friendly shapes and treat prose-routed behaviour as deprecated. Specifically:

- **Routing decisions**: declare `when:` predicates against named output_format fields, not prose instructions. The strict-Archon grammar at `hive/references/predicate-grammar.md` is small on purpose; conformance to it is what makes routing mechanical.
- **Step outputs**: declare structured `outputs:` with explicit names and types. Downstream `when:` predicates and `inputs:` bindings address those named fields.
- **Step files**: include an `OUTPUT FORMAT` block listing the named fields the step is contracted to emit. The executor binds predicates by name; prose-only outputs that "encode" a routing signal in narrative are a deprecated pattern (see PR #31's metric_signal/findings conflation, structurally retired by hde-3b's output_format contract on `step-02-analysis`).
- **Multi-domain forks**: declare two declarative nodes with `when:` predicates rather than a single prose step that branches inline. The grammar has no `contains` operator on purpose; pre-compute booleans on a story-context node's outputs and predicate against those (see `hive/references/story-spec-schema.md`).

Workflows that ship today as prose-routed (and have not been graduated to the executor registry) continue to work unchanged. Treat that path as **maintenance-mode**: existing workflows are still supported under the orchestrator, but new prose-routed workflows are discouraged. The migration path is documented in `hive/decisions/001-executor-cutover.md`.

## Ceremony Workflow Variant

The current `daily-ceremony.workflow.yaml` is expressed as flat `steps:`, not `phases:`. The ceremony remains a distinct operational variant because ordering is carried by the step ids plus barrier-style sequencing, and execution remains orchestrator-driven rather than a per-phase multi-agent swarm.

Ceremony workflows differ from standard development workflows in these ways:

1. **Sequential coordination** — effective order is enforced by the declared step graph and barrier steps, not by a separate `phases:` collection
2. **Orchestrator-executed** — the orchestrator drives the ceremony flow directly; it does not spawn a dedicated per-phase agent roster
