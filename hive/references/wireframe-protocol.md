# Wireframe Approval Protocol

This document defines the human-in-the-loop approval flow for wireframes. The UI designer agent creates wireframes; this protocol governs how the user reviews and approves them before they're embedded in story specs or design briefs.

## Canonical entry point

`/hive:design` is the canonical entry point that runs this protocol. It is callable two ways:

- **Standalone** — for ad-hoc UI exploration, mid-execution redesigns, and polish passes. No prior planning state is required.
- **/plan-delegated** — `/plan` Phase C step 16 (UI detection) invokes `/design` via an atomic external Skill call when a story matches the UI-keyword detection. `/plan` does NOT inline the wireframe ceremony.

See [`skills/design/SKILL.md`](../../skills/design/SKILL.md) for the full skill contract. This document defines the touchpoint protocol that skill applies.

## Headless Mode

Epic `headless-question-protocol`, story `hqp-4-design-headless-integration`. Before
either touchpoint below, call `hive/lib/runtime_mode.py`'s
`detect_interactive_mode()` (Python) or `hive/lib/runtime_mode.js`'s
`detectInteractiveMode()` (JS).

**Interactive** (`mode: "interactive"`): unchanged — both touchpoints call
`AskUserQuestion` exactly as written below. The "direct user access, not a background
teammate" constraint (see "Touchpoint Execution Context" below) applies to this path
only.

**Headless** (`mode: "headless"`): call `hive/lib/question_gateway.py`'s
`ask_or_emit(skill="design", phase="<phase-id>", questions=[...])` (Python) or
`hive/lib/question_gateway.js`'s
`askOrEmit({skill: "design", phase: "<phase-id>", questions: [...]})` (JS) instead of
`AskUserQuestion`. On `resolved: false`, print the `AWAITING_ANSWERS` status and stop
`/design` here; the orchestrator answers the envelope and re-invokes `/design`, which
resumes at this phase. On `resolved: true`, use the answer exactly as if the user had
selected it interactively. Writing an envelope and returning control is not "running
in a background teammate" — the constraint above doesn't apply to the headless path.

**Phase ids are topic-scoped.** The gateway's envelope lookup
(`find_envelope_for_phase`) is keyed by `skill` + `phase` only — it has no concept
of "which invocation." Unlike kickoff/plan (effectively one invocation in flight
per project), `/design` explicitly supports multiple concurrent topics
(`.pHive/wireframes/{epic}/{story}/`, `.pHive/design/<topic>/`). Two unrelated
`/design` runs for different topics started close together would both write
envelopes for phase `touchpoint-1-round-1` (topic-less), and a resume for one topic
could silently match the other topic's more-recent envelope. To prevent this, the phase
id **always includes the topic slug**:

| Phase id | Touchpoint | Round |
|---|---|---|
| `touchpoint-1-round-1-<topic>` | Rendition selection | First presentation |
| `touchpoint-1-round-2-<topic>`, `-round-3-<topic>`, … | Rendition selection | After "Request changes" / "More options" |
| `touchpoint-2-round-1-<topic>` | Brief sign-off | First presentation |
| `touchpoint-2-round-2-<topic>`, … | Brief sign-off | After "Edit" |

`<topic>` is the same slug used for `.pHive/design/<topic>/` (see
`skills/design/SKILL.md` for how the topic is derived from the brief/story). Two
different topics can never collide, because the phase id itself disambiguates them
— no gateway code change is needed, `phase` is an opaque string from the gateway's
perspective already (it's compared for equality, never used to construct a
filesystem path — the envelope filename is `<skill>-<invocation-id>.yaml`, with no
`phase`-derived component). `<topic>` MUST already be a validated slug before
reaching this protocol — `/design` normalizes/rejects non-kebab-case input (`/`,
`..`, etc.) at its own `--topic` boundary for `.pHive/design/<topic>/`; this
protocol relies on that existing validation rather than re-validating here.

**Determining the current round on resume.** Unlike kickoff/plan's phases (each
asked at most once per invocation, so linear script order alone tells the skill
where it is), a touchpoint's round number is not derivable from control flow
alone when `/design` is resumed as a **fresh process** — the round state lives only
in `.pHive/questions/`, not in any other persisted file. On every resume (including
the very first attempt at a touchpoint, for the topic currently being resolved),
determine the round to use by probing starting at round 1:

1. Call `find_envelope_for_phase(skill="design", phase="touchpoint-<N>-round-1-<topic>")`.
   This is a **read-only reconnaissance call** — `find_envelope_for_phase` never
   mutates or deletes anything; only `ask_or_emit` does that, on successful answer
   extraction. The probe is purely for choosing WHICH round-suffixed phase id to
   pass to `ask_or_emit` next — it is never a substitute for calling it.
2. If no envelope exists yet, this is a fresh touchpoint — use round 1.
3. If an envelope exists and is `answered`:
   - Selection/approval answer ("Rendition K" / "Approve") → the touchpoint is
     resolved at this round; do not open a new round.
   - Iteration answer ("Request changes" / "More options" / "Edit") → advance to
     round 2 and repeat this probe (`find_envelope_for_phase` for
     `touchpoint-<N>-round-2-<topic>`), continuing until an unanswered or
     nonexistent round is found.
4. If an envelope exists and is still `pending`, that round is the current one —
   resume there (per Headless Mode above), don't start a new round.
5. Once the current round is determined, call `ask_or_emit()` for that exact
   round-suffixed phase id — the same call the skill would make in any other
   headless flow. `ask_or_emit`'s own `resolved: true` return (with the answer)
   is what actually consumes and deletes the envelope; the probe above never
   reads `questions[].answer` directly off the raw envelope it inspected. This
   keeps a single code path (`ask_or_emit`) as the only place closure-invariant
   validation and deletion happen, regardless of how many probe rounds ran first.

This probe is O(rounds so far), which is bounded in practice (iteration loops don't
run indefinitely) and mirrors how the gateway itself already resolves a single
phase — it's just applied repeatedly across the round sequence, scoped to one
topic.

**Out of scope: mid-flow process restart before reaching a touchpoint.** This
protocol governs resumption exactly at a blocking touchpoint (the skill wrote an
envelope and exited; a later invocation picks up from there). It does NOT change
what happens if a headless `/design` process is killed and restarted **before**
reaching Touchpoint 1 — e.g. mid-Phase-A wireframe generation. Whether such a
restart re-runs generation from scratch or detects and reuses partial artifacts is
pre-existing `/design` behavior, identical in interactive and headless mode, and
this epic does not change it.

**Kickoff and plan are not topic-scoped (known v1 limitation).** Their phase ids
(`1a`, `1b`, `branch-switch-confirm`, etc.) assume at most one invocation in flight
per project — reasonable today (kickoff/plan aren't normally run concurrently
against the same project), but not enforced. If concurrent kickoff/plan
invocations against the same project ever become a real scenario, their phase ids
will need the same topic/invocation-scoping treatment as design's.

## When This Runs

Whenever `/hive:design` runs — either standalone or delegated from `/hive:plan` during planning of a net-new UI story. The UI designer agent runs through the touchpoints below; wireframes are produced and approved **before** stories are finalized so by execution time developers already have the approved design context.

## Rendition Support

- **Default:** 1 rendition per screen/component
- **Configurable:** via story config field `renditions: N` or plan command flag `--renditions N`
- Each rendition is a layout/component variation of the same screen
- All renditions are exported to: `.pHive/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/`

## Touchpoint 1 — Wireframe Approval

After the UI designer produces renditions:

1. **Present renditions.** Show file paths and suggest the user open them:
   ```
   Wireframe renditions for "{story-title}":
     1. .pHive/wireframes/{epic}/{story}/v1.png
     2. .pHive/wireframes/{epic}/{story}/v2.png
     3. .pHive/wireframes/{epic}/{story}/v3.png
   ```
   If Claude Code can read images (Read tool on PNG), present them inline.

2. **Ask for selection.** Use AskUserQuestion (headless: phase `touchpoint-1-round-<N>-<topic>` — see Headless Mode above) with options:
   - "Rendition 1" / "Rendition 2" / "Rendition N" — approve that version
   - "Request changes" — provide feedback, re-run UI designer with context
   - "More options" — generate additional renditions

3. **Iterate if needed.** On "Request changes" or "More options", pass the user's feedback to the UI designer and repeat from step 1, incrementing the round counter (headless: next envelope is `touchpoint-1-round-<N+1>-<topic>`). No limit on iterations — the user decides when to approve.

4. **Lock selection.** Once approved, record the selected rendition index.

## Touchpoint 2 — Story Brief Sign-off

After wireframe selection:

1. **Present the design brief.** Show the structured brief that will be embedded in the story YAML:
   - Screen name and layout description
   - Component list with positioning rationale
   - Interaction notes (tap targets, navigation, state changes)
   - Accessibility notes
   - Export command for downstream agents

2. **Ask for approval.** Use AskUserQuestion (headless: phase `touchpoint-2-round-<N>-<topic>` — see Headless Mode above):
   - "Approve" — embed in story YAML
   - "Edit" — collect changes via Other/free-text, update brief, re-present (headless: next envelope is `touchpoint-2-round-<N+1>-<topic>`)

3. **Embed in story.** Once approved, append the `wireframes` section to the story YAML file.

## Story YAML Wireframes Section

Appended to the story file after approval:

```yaml
wireframes:
  approved: .pHive/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/v{N}.png
  brief: |
    Structured design brief text describing layout decisions,
    component choices, and interaction patterns.
  export_command: |
    cli-anything-frame-zero --live export page --page "{page-id}" --format png --output .pHive/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/approved.png
  renditions:
    - .pHive/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/v1.png
    - .pHive/wireframes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/v2.png
  selected: 1
```

This section gives the developer agent everything needed to implement the design:
- **approved** — path to the chosen wireframe image
- **brief** — text description of design decisions
- **export_command** — CLI command to re-export (if agent needs a fresh copy)
- **renditions** — all versions for reference
- **selected** — which rendition was approved

## Touchpoint Execution Context

- Touchpoints are **blocking** — planning halts until the user responds
- Touchpoints require **direct user access** — they must run in the main session or team lead, not in a background teammate
- The `AskUserQuestion` tool supports 2-4 options plus a free-text "Other" option
- For complex feedback, use "Other" to collect free-form text

## Integration with Workflows

The wireframe protocol is NOT a workflow step in `development.*.workflow.yaml`. It runs during **planning**, not execution. The plan command invokes the UI designer and runs touchpoints as part of story creation. By the time `/hive:execute` starts, stories already contain the `wireframes` section.

## Handoff Payload Contract

The wireframe handoff payload is the bundled artifact set that /design produces and downstream consumers (e.g., /design-review, manual review, future Hermes) consume. The payload shape is **extensible-minimum**: at minimum these three fields, downstream consumers MAY require additional fields, and new fields are add-only.

Minimum payload fields:

- `wireframe.png` — PNG render of the wireframe (always present)
- `wireframe.f0` — Frame0 source (always present)
- `constraints.md` — bundled accessibility + animations constraint notes (present when /design was invoked with `--include-constraints`, absent otherwise)

**Posture:** extensible-minimum. Downstream consumers MAY require additional fields. New fields are add-only and reversible — earlier consumers seeing fewer fields will not break. This posture was set by TPM escalation in outline-collab-review-record (cite: 'the minimum payload, d-5 is free to add fields if a downstream consumer surfaces a need during the manual exercise step').

When /design `--include-constraints` is ON, the `constraints.md` field is populated with the bundled accessibility-specialist + animations-specialist constraint notes produced by /design Phase A (d-1). When the flag is OFF, the `constraints.md` field is absent or empty; PNG + .f0 always ship.

The payload is **field-named** (not file-glob-based) so bundle composition cannot accidentally leak ui-designer working state. Only the three named fields above are part of the canonical minimum; additional fields require explicit naming.

**Q9 resolution** (design-discussion.md §6): "Wireframe-artifact handoff payload — PNG + `.f0` only, or include constraint doc from accessibility + animations?" Resolved: PNG + `.f0` + bundled constraint doc. Payload contract locked per user Q9 resolution and outline-collab-review-record researcher review.

**Artifact producers:** d-1 (Phase A, `/design` skill) produces the constituent constraint artifacts (`accessibility-constraints.md` + `animations-constraints.md`). d-3 (`design-mode-multica`) and d-4 (`design-mode-cc-workflows`) produce per-persona outputs that become the constituent artifacts. d-5 defines this payload shape — the bundle field names and extensible-minimum posture.
