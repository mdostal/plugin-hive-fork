Initialize Hive for a project. Detects brownfield vs greenfield automatically.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` optionally describes the project or intent.

## Headless Mode

Epic `headless-question-protocol`, story `hqp-3-kickoff-headless-integration`. Before
any "Ask the user" / "Ask:" instruction below, call `hive/lib/runtime_mode.py`'s
`detect_interactive_mode()` (Python) — or `hive/lib/runtime_mode.js`'s
`detectInteractiveMode()` (JS; camelCase, this repo's existing per-language naming
convention — see `hive/lib/config.py`/`hive/lib/config.js` for prior art). Both take
the same shape of input and return the same `{mode, source}` shape.

**Interactive** (the common case — `mode: "interactive"`): no change. Ask exactly as
written below.

**Headless** (`mode: "headless"`): instead of prompting inline, call
`hive/lib/question_gateway.py`'s `ask_or_emit(skill="kickoff", phase="<phase-id>",
questions=[...])` (Python) — or `hive/lib/question_gateway.js`'s
`askOrEmit({skill: "kickoff", phase: "<phase-id>", questions: [...]})` (JS) —
batching every question for that phase boundary into one call (see
`hive/references/question-envelope-schema.md` for why phase-batching, not
per-question). Two outcomes:

- `resolved: false` — print the envelope's `AWAITING_ANSWERS` status (its
  `envelope_path` and `deadline`) and **stop this kickoff invocation here**. Do not
  proceed past this phase. The driving orchestrator answers the envelope
  (`.pHive/questions/kickoff-<invocation-id>.yaml`) and re-invokes `/hive:kickoff`,
  which resumes at this phase (`find_envelope_for_phase` matches the answered
  envelope) instead of re-asking.
- `resolved: true` — use `answers["<qid>"]` exactly as if the user had typed that
  answer interactively, and continue immediately without prompting.

**Phase-id table** (used by both the gateway calls above and this document's
headings):

| Phase id | Section | Questions batched |
|---|---|---|
| `scenario-detect` | Step 1: Detect Scenario | The rare "ambiguous brownfield vs greenfield" prompt |
| `1a` | Step 1a: Metrics Opt-In / Preservation | Fresh opt-in OR re-kickoff change prompt (same phase id either way — mutually exclusive paths) |
| `1b` | Step 1b: Ship Target Elicitation / Preservation | Fresh elicitation OR re-kickoff change prompt |
| `project-classification` | `skills/kickoff/SKILL.md` only — not documented as a numbered Step in this file (see note below) | `project_type` + `has_ui` |
| `2b-ii` | Phase 2b-ii: Developer Discovery, Step 2 | All 7 numbered elicitation items (see that section's qid table) |
| `4b` | Phase 4b: Scaffold CONTEXT.md | The backfill opt-in prompt |

**`project-classification` note:** `skills/kickoff/SKILL.md` asks `project_type` and
`has_ui` for every kickoff, but before this protocol was added, this document had no
corresponding numbered Step or detailed contract for them — no validation rules,
config-write pattern, or re-kickoff handling was specified here, only in `SKILL.md`.
That's a pre-existing gap between the two files, not introduced by this protocol.
Registered as a phase id here (the two terms now appear in the table row above)
so the phase-id namespace stays centrally discoverable even though the detailed
contract still lives only in `SKILL.md`.

**Out of scope for this protocol:** Step 2B's greenfield **Product Discovery**
(delegated to the analyst persona's Socratic conversation) is a multi-turn, free-form
dialogue, not a discrete question/option prompt — it is not covered by the
question-gateway, which is designed for structured, enumerable questions. A headless
greenfield kickoff still reaches that step; it is unaffected by (and untouched by)
this integration.

## Step 0: Legacy state/ Migration Check

Before any other work:

1. Read `hive.config.yaml` if present and resolve `STATE_DIR = paths.state_dir`
   (fall back to `.pHive` if unset).
2. If `STATE_DIR` is explicitly set to `state` → the user has opted to keep
   the legacy directory. Skip the migration check entirely and continue.
   Do not prompt on subsequent runs.
3. Otherwise, check the filesystem:
   - If both `state/` and `.pHive/` exist → warn the user, do not auto-migrate.
     They likely have a half-finished migration. Tell them to resolve manually.
   - If only `state/` exists (no `.pHive/`) → strongly recommend migration:
     - Show: "Found legacy state/ directory. Hive v1.2+ uses .pHive/ by default,
       and all shipped skills/workflows now reference `.pHive/` directly.
       Migrate now? (yes/no)"
     - **yes**: run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/migrate-state-to-pHive.sh`
     - **no**: skip and continue. **Important caveat:** `paths.state_dir` in
       `hive.config.yaml` is not yet honored by all skills, so keeping `state/`
       without migrating will cause skills that hardcode `.pHive/` paths to
       write to a new empty directory. Tell the user this explicitly, and
       suggest a symlink (`ln -s state .pHive`) as a stopgap if they cannot
       migrate right now. Next kickoff run will ask again.
   - If only `.pHive/` exists or neither → no action needed.

This step is idempotent — safe to re-run on any project.

## Step 1: Detect Scenario

Check the current working directory:
- **Has existing source code** (src/, lib/, app/, package.json, build.gradle, etc.) → **Brownfield**
- **Empty or minimal** (just a README, no source) → **Greenfield**
- **Ambiguous** → Ask the user (headless: phase `scenario-detect` — see Headless Mode above)

## Step 1a: Metrics Opt-In / Preservation

Before entering the brownfield or greenfield path, inspect `hive.config.yaml` for an
existing `metrics.enabled` value.

- If `metrics.enabled` is absent, treat this as a fresh kickoff prompt.
- If `metrics.enabled` is already present, treat this as a re-kickoff preservation
  branch regardless of whether the project is brownfield or greenfield.

### Fresh kickoff path

Ask the user (headless: phase `1a` — see Headless Mode above):

`Enable metrics tracking?`

Keep the explanation inline and short: opting in enables metric-driven
meta-optimization later; opting out keeps metrics off and future meta runs fall back
to qualitative/backlog-fallback mode.

Add a clearly labeled consequence line immediately with the question:

`Consequence of opting out: metrics stay off. Meta work will use qualitative/backlog mode, and future metric-driven optimization features won't be available.`

Follow it with the matching future-facing clause:

`Opting in is what would unlock metric-driven behavior for those future skills.`

Default to `no`. The user must actively choose `yes` to enable metrics. Empty
input, unclear input, or any non-yes answer leaves metrics disabled.

Persist the answer to `hive.config.yaml` using the existing kickoff config write
pattern:

1. Write the final choice to `metrics.enabled`
2. `yes` → `metrics.enabled: true`
3. `no` or default-off path → `metrics.enabled: false`

Example result in `hive.config.yaml`:

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
```

### Re-kickoff preservation path

If `hive.config.yaml` already contains `metrics.enabled`:

1. Read the current `metrics.enabled` value from `hive.config.yaml` before
   prompting.
2. Show the current value explicitly to the user, for example: `Metrics tracking is
   currently enabled.` or `Metrics tracking is currently disabled.`
3. Ask a change prompt, not the fresh opt-in question. Example: `Do you want to
   change metrics tracking from its current setting?`
   - **Headless (phase `1a`, same phase id as the fresh path — the two are mutually
     exclusive):** ask the change-decision and the replacement value **in the same
     envelope**, as two qids (`change_metrics: yes/no` and
     `replacement_metrics_value: yes/no`), not as a decision followed by a
     conditional follow-up round. Consumed envelopes are deleted on extraction (see
     `hive/references/question-envelope-schema.md`'s "Deletion on consume"), so a
     hypothetical second "if yes, what's the replacement" call for phase `1a` after
     the decision envelope was already consumed would find nothing to match and
     write a **brand-new** envelope — it would NOT re-match the (now-deleted)
     prior answer, and the skill has no separate qid defined for that follow-up
     anyway. Avoiding that path entirely (rather than adding a `1a-round-2`
     envelope, the pattern used elsewhere in this protocol for genuine
     validation-failure retries) is why both values are batched up front instead:
     it saves the extra round trip a round-2 envelope would cost, not because of
     any stale-match risk. `replacement_metrics_value` is simply ignored when
     `change_metrics: no`.
4. If the user keeps the existing value, preserve it as-is and do not write
   `hive.config.yaml`.
5. If the user explicitly chooses to change it, collect the replacement setting
   and write only the new boolean to `metrics.enabled` using the existing kickoff
   config write pattern:
   - replacement answer `yes` → `metrics.enabled: true`
   - replacement answer `no`, empty, or any other response → `metrics.enabled: false`

This preservation branch applies equally to brownfield re-kickoff and greenfield
re-kickoff so an existing metrics setting is never reset just because kickoff ran
again.

---

## Step 1b: Ship Target Elicitation / Preservation

Before entering the brownfield or greenfield path, make sure
`.pHive/project-profile.yaml` has a concrete `ship_target` block. `/ship` reads
this block and must not infer what "shipped" means for the project.

The valid schema is:

```yaml
ship_target:
  kind: app-store | vercel | github-release | npm | custom
  command: "<shell command>" # required only when kind == custom
  notes: "<optional human note, e.g. which Vercel project / npm scope>"
```

Allowed `kind` values:

| Kind | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `app-store` | Shipping means App Store / Play Store submission or release. |
| `vercel` | Shipping means deploying the project through Vercel. |
| `github-release` | Shipping means creating a GitHub release. |
| `npm` | Shipping means publishing an npm package. |
| `custom` | Shipping means running the provided shell command. |

For Hive itself, set `kind: github-release` because this repository ships via
GitHub releases.

### Fresh kickoff path

Ask the user (headless: phase `1b` — see Headless Mode above):

`What does shipping mean for this project?`

Present the allowed kinds in the prompt:

`Choose one: app-store, vercel, github-release, npm, custom.`

**Headless:** batch the kind selection, the optional note, and the custom command
into the **same** `1b` envelope — three qids (`ship_kind`, `ship_notes`,
`custom_command`); validation of the answers happens on resume, not via a
follow-up round (see below), rather than asking `ship_kind` first and conditionally
following up for `custom_command` in a second round. As with `1a`'s
change/replacement pair, this avoids the extra round trip a `1b-round-2` envelope
would cost for the common case where `custom_command` is answered correctly the
first time — see step 4 below for what actually happens when it isn't.
`custom_command` is ignored when `ship_kind` isn't `custom`.

Then:

1. Record the selected kind as `ship_target.kind`.
2. Ask for an optional note, such as the Vercel project name, npm scope, release
   channel, or store track. If provided, record it as `ship_target.notes`.
3. If the selected kind is `custom`, ask for the shell command that performs the
   ship action.
4. If `kind == custom` and the command is empty or missing, re-prompt:
   `Custom shipping requires a command string. What command should /ship run?`
   **Headless:** the batched `custom_command` qid was already asked up front (see
   above); if the orchestrator's answer was still empty, write a **new** envelope
   at phase `1b-round-2` (same round-suffix convention as design's touchpoints —
   see `hive/references/wireframe-protocol.md`) asking only for `custom_command`.
   Reusing phase `1b` for the retry would not work regardless of the empty
   answer's content: the `1b` envelope was already consumed and deleted (see
   `hive/references/question-envelope-schema.md`'s "Deletion on consume") the
   moment its answers were extracted, so a second `ask_or_emit()` call for phase
   `1b` at this point would just write a **fresh, unrelated** `1b` envelope — not
   recover or re-ask the specific missing `custom_command` value. The `-round-2`
   suffix is what makes this retry a distinct, addressable phase.
5. Do not write a `custom` ship target until a non-empty command is collected.
6. Security note: a `custom` command runs in a shell at ship time. Kickoff only
   enforces the non-empty check; command sanitization and injection safety are
   deferred to the `/ship` executor, which presents the resolved action as a
   dry-run and requires explicit operator confirmation before executing it.

Example custom result:

```yaml
ship_target:
  kind: custom
  command: "make release-prod"
  notes: "Runs the internal release wrapper."
```

### Re-kickoff preservation path

If `.pHive/project-profile.yaml` already contains a valid `ship_target` block:

1. Read and show the current value to the user.
2. Ask a change prompt (headless: phase `1b`, same phase id as the fresh path), for example:
   `Shipping is currently configured as github-release. Do you want to change it?`
3. If the user keeps the existing value, preserve it exactly and do not rewrite
   `ship_target`.
4. If the user changes it, collect the replacement using the fresh kickoff rules
   above, including the required command validation for `custom`.

If `.pHive/project-profile.yaml` exists but lacks `ship_target`, add only the
`ship_target` block. Preserve every existing top-level field and nested section
unchanged, including manual edits. Re-running kickoff after adding the block must
be idempotent.

If `.pHive/project-profile.yaml` does not exist yet, include `ship_target` when
the profile is created in Phase 3.

## Step 2A: Brownfield — Discovery & Onboarding

**Goal:** Build a comprehensive knowledge base so Hive agents understand the project before any planning or execution begins.

### Phase 1: Read Existing Knowledge FIRST

Before scanning any code, read what the project already knows about itself:

1. **CLAUDE.md** — THE primary source. Read it completely. It contains build commands, conventions, architecture decisions, known issues, and rules that the developers have already documented. Every finding here takes precedence over what you discover by scanning code.

2. **.claude/** directory — check for:
   - `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` — project-level config, enabled MCP servers
   - `commands/` — existing slash commands
   - `agents/` — existing agent definitions
   - `skills/` — existing skills
   - `memory.db` — prior Claude Code context

3. **Other documentation:**
   - `README.md` — project overview
   - `docs/` — architecture docs, ADRs, briefs, stories, sprint status
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Any `.md` files in project root

**Key principle:** CLAUDE.md is authoritative. If CLAUDE.md says "use X convention" and the code shows a mix of X and Y, the answer is X — the code has drift, not the doc.

### Phase 2: Codebase Discovery

Now scan the code to fill gaps not covered by documentation:

1. **Project structure** — key directories, modules, entry points
   - Don't just list top-level dirs — understand what each contains
   - For monorepos: identify each package/module and its purpose

2. **Tech stack detection** — languages, frameworks, build tools
   - Read build configs: `build.gradle.kts`, `package.json`, `Podfile`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
   - Check version pins and dependency lists

3. **Test infrastructure** — THIS IS CRITICAL, get it right:
   - **Don't assume standard test locations.** Different frameworks put tests in different places:
     - KMP/Kotlin: `src/commonTest/`, `src/androidTest/`, `src/iosTest/`, `src/jvmTest/`
     - JavaScript: `__tests__/`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts` alongside source
     - Python: `tests/`, `test_*.py` alongside source
     - Swift: `*Tests/`, XCTest targets in Xcode project
     - E2E: `.maestro/`, `_testing/`, `cypress/`, `playwright/`
   - **Count actual test files** by searching for test patterns in the framework's convention
   - Check for coverage configs: `jacoco`, `kover`, `istanbul`, `coverage/`
   - Check for mocking/faking: `mockk`, `mockito`, `jest.mock`, fakes directories
   - Check test runner configs: `jest.config`, `pytest.ini`, `build.gradle` test tasks

4. **Architecture patterns** — scan actual code, not just file structure:
   - DI framework (Koin, Dagger, manual)
   - State management (Flow, StateFlow, Redux, MobX)
   - Navigation (Compose Navigation, React Router, Express routes)
   - Data layer (repositories, services, API clients)
   - Read 2-3 representative files to confirm patterns

5. **CI/CD** — `.github/workflows/`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`

6. **Existing project management:**
   - Sprint/story files in `docs/`
   - Linear/Jira/YouTrack integration in `.claude/settings`
   - Branch naming conventions (check recent git branches)

### Phase 2b: Extended Discovery (Placeholders)

These sub-phases extend brownfield discovery with deeper project analysis. Each writes to a specific section of the project profile. All new fields are optional with sensible defaults — existing kickoff output is unchanged until detection logic is implemented.

**Execution order:** 2b-i (Integration Preflight) and 2b-iii (Code Quality) run first (parallel — no dependency on each other). Then 2b-ii (Developer Discovery) runs using test-first signals from 2b-iii for smart defaults. Finally 2b-iv (Cross-Cutting Concerns) runs using outputs from all prior phases.

#### Phase 2b-i: Integration Preflight

<!-- TODO: Implement integration detection logic (story: integration-preflight) -->
<!-- DATA CONTRACT: Writes to project-profile.yaml → integrations: {} -->
<!-- Detects: CLI tools (linearis, frame0, codex, maestro), MCP servers (firecrawl, context7, posthog, firebase, mobile-mcp), vaults (obsidian) -->
<!-- Default: integrations: {cli_tools: {}, mcp_servers: {}, vaults: {}} -->
<!-- Note: This populates integrations.mcp_servers (detected), NOT existing_knowledge.mcp_servers (manually declared) -->

Scan the development environment for available integrations. Check for CLI tools, MCP server configurations, and knowledge vaults. Results inform which Hive capabilities are available during execution.

#### Phase 2b-ii: Developer Discovery

<!-- DATA CONTRACT: Writes to hive.config.yaml → developer: {} -->
<!-- Discovers: pr_style, commit_granularity, review_depth, notes -->
<!-- Also populates: execution.default_methodology via elicitation -->

Elicit developer preferences for PR workflow, commit style, and review expectations. These preferences configure Hive's execution behavior to match the developer's working style.

##### Idempotent Guard

Before eliciting, check `hive.config.yaml` for existing developer preferences:

1. Read the `developer:` section from `hive.config.yaml`
2. If **any** of `pr_style`, `commit_granularity`, or `review_depth` are non-null → **skip elicitation entirely**
3. Print: `Developer preferences already configured — skipping discovery.`
4. Continue to Phase 2b-iv

This ensures `kickoff` can be re-run without re-asking questions the developer already answered.

##### Step 1: Infer Smart Defaults from Test-First Signals

Read `code_quality.test_first_signals` from `project-profile.yaml` (populated by Phase 2b-iii which runs before this phase). Apply this decision table to determine the methodology default:

| Priority | Condition | Default Methodology |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | `bdd_keywords: true` | **BDD** |
| 2 | `co_located_tests: true` AND (`test_before_source: true` OR `test_runner_in_precommit: true`) | **TDD** |
| 3 | `co_located_tests: true` (alone) | **TDD** |
| 4 | `test_absence: true` | **Classic** |
| 5 | No signals available or all inconclusive | **Classic** |

Rules:
- BDD wins over TDD when both signals are present (BDD is a superset of TDD practices)
- When signals conflict, prefer the higher-priority row
- If `test_first_signals` is missing entirely (unexpected — Phase 2b-iii should have run first), default to **Classic**

Also infer a PR style default from recent git history:
- Run `git log --oneline -20` and check merge patterns
- Mostly merge commits with single parents → `single-commit`
- Squash merge messages (e.g., "Squashed commit of…") → `squash-merge`
- No clear pattern or fresh repo → `single-commit` (safe default)

##### Step 2: Present Elicitation (7 Questions)

Present the questions as a single conversational block. The tone should feel like a colleague asking preferences, not a form to fill out.

**Headless (phase `2b-ii` — see Headless Mode above):** batch all 7 qids below into
one `ask_or_emit()` call, each `answer` defaulting to the listed inferred default
when the orchestrator has no preference — there is no headless equivalent of
"press Enter to accept all," so every qid must receive an explicit answer (echoing
back the default has the same effect as accepting it):

| qid | Options | Inferred default | Config field (Step 3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `methodology` | `classic` \| `tdd` \| `bdd` | Per the Priority table above | `execution.default_methodology` |
| `pr_style` | `single-commit` \| `squash-merge` \| `atomic-prs` \| `bundled` | Per git-history inference above | `developer.pr_style` |
| `commit_granularity` | `fine` \| `medium` \| `coarse` | `medium` (feature-scoped) | `developer.commit_granularity` |
| `review_depth` | `thorough` \| `standard` \| `light` | `standard` | `developer.review_depth` |
| `collaborative_reviews` | `on` \| `off` | `on` | `planning.collaborative_review` (`on`→`true`, `off`→`false`) |
| `github_sync` | `on` \| `off` | `off` | `meta_team.github_forwarding` (`on`→`true`, `off`→`false`) |
| `notes` | free text | `""` (none) | `developer.notes` (`null` if empty) |

**Prompt template:**

```
I've detected some patterns in your codebase. Here are my suggested defaults
for how Hive should work with you — press Enter to accept all, or type the
number(s) you'd like to change (e.g., "1,3"):

  1. Methodology:           {inferred_methodology} {reason_hint}
  2. PR style:              {inferred_pr_style}
  3. Commit granularity:    feature-scoped
  4. Review depth:          standard
  5. Collaborative reviews: on
  6. Meta-team GitHub sync: off
  7. Additional notes:      (none)

Options for each:
  1 → Classic / TDD / BDD
  2 → single-commit / squash-merge / atomic-prs / bundled
  3 → fine (per-change) / medium (per-task) / coarse (per-story)
  4 → thorough / standard / light
  5 → on / off (team review gates during planning — adds quality but takes longer)
  6 → on / off (meta-team files plugin-level issues to GitHub — off keeps everything local)
  7 → free text (workflow preferences, pet peeves, anything Hive should know)
```

The `{reason_hint}` after methodology briefly explains why that default was chosen:
- `(co-located tests suggest test-first)` → TDD
- `(BDD keywords found in test files)` → BDD
- `(no strong test-first signals)` → Classic

**Interaction flow:**

1. If the developer presses **Enter** (empty input) → accept all defaults as-is
2. If the developer types numbers (e.g., `1,3`) → prompt for each selected question individually:
   - `Methodology (Classic/TDD/BDD):` and wait for input
   - `Commit granularity (fine/medium/coarse):` and wait for input
3. For Q5 (collaborative reviews), if selected: `Collaborative reviews (on/off):` and wait for input
4. For Q6 (meta-team GitHub sync), if selected: `Meta-team GitHub sync (on/off):` and wait for input
5. For Q7 (notes), if selected: `Any notes for Hive? (workflow preferences, things to avoid, etc.):` and capture free text
6. Validate inputs — if an answer doesn't match known options, show the options again (once). On second invalid input, keep the default.

##### Step 3: Write Preferences to Config

Write the final values (defaults + any overrides) to `hive.config.yaml`:

1. **Methodology** → `execution.default_methodology` (update the EXISTING field — do NOT create a new `developer.methodology` field)
2. **PR style** → `developer.pr_style`
3. **Commit granularity** → `developer.commit_granularity`
4. **Review depth** → `developer.review_depth`
5. **Collaborative reviews** → `planning.collaborative_review` (on = `true`, off = `false`)
6. **Meta-team GitHub sync** → `meta_team.github_forwarding` (on = `true`, off = `false`)
7. **Notes** → `developer.notes` (null if no notes provided)

Example result in `hive.config.yaml`:

```yaml
execution:
  default_methodology: tdd    # ← updated by developer discovery

developer:
  pr_style: single-commit
  commit_granularity: medium
  review_depth: standard
  notes: "I prefer small PRs. Always run tests before pushing."
```

##### Step 4: Confirm and Continue

After writing, print a brief confirmation:

```
Got it! Your preferences are saved to hive.config.yaml.
You can update them anytime by editing the file directly.
```

Continue to Phase 2b-iv.

#### Phase 2b-iii: Code Quality & Linter Detection

Detect code quality tooling, extract representative code snippets, and collect test-first heuristic signals. All results write to `project-profile.yaml → code_quality`. Idempotent on re-run: merge new discoveries, preserve existing entries (including manual edits).

<!-- DATA CONTRACT: Writes to project-profile.yaml → code_quality: {} and project_maturity: "" -->
<!-- Default: code_quality: {linters: [], formatters: [], pre_commit: {framework: null, hooks: []}, code_snippets: []}; project_maturity: "not_detected" -->

##### Step 1: Linter & Formatter Detection (8 patterns)

Scan for config files across 4 ecosystems. V1 ceiling: 2 patterns per ecosystem = 8 total.

| Ecosystem | Pattern 1 | Pattern 2 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **JavaScript** | `.eslintrc.*` (any extension: `.js`, `.cjs`, `.json`, `.yml`) | `eslint.config.js` or `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config) |
| **Python** | `pyproject.toml` containing `[tool.ruff]` | `.flake8` |
| **Kotlin** | `detekt.yml` or `.detekt.yml` | `build.gradle.kts` containing `ktlint` or `spotless` plugin |
| **Swift** | `.swiftlint.yml` | `.swiftformat` |

For each match found:

1. **Extract tool name** — the linter/formatter name (e.g., `eslint`, `ruff`, `detekt`, `swiftlint`)
2. **Record config path** — relative path to the config file
3. **Infer lint command** — best-guess run command (e.g., `npx eslint .`, `ruff check .`, `./gradlew detekt`, `swiftlint`)
4. **Write to** `code_quality.linters[]`:

```yaml
code_quality:
  linters:
    - name: eslint
      config_path: .eslintrc.js
      lint_command: "npx eslint ."
      ecosystem: javascript
    - name: ruff
      config_path: pyproject.toml
      lint_command: "ruff check ."
      ecosystem: python
```

Also detect formatters alongside linters — common pairs:

| Ecosystem | Formatter pattern |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **JavaScript** | `.prettierrc`, `.prettierrc.*`, `prettier.config.js` |
| **Python** | `pyproject.toml` containing `[tool.black]` or `[tool.ruff.format]` |
| **Kotlin** | `spotless` plugin in `build.gradle.kts` |
| **Swift** | `.swiftformat` (also a formatter) |

Write formatter entries to `code_quality.formatters[]` with the same shape as linters.

**If no linters or formatters are found**, write empty arrays — do not omit the keys:
```yaml
code_quality:
  linters: []
  formatters: []
```

##### Step 2: Pre-Commit Hook Detection

Check for pre-commit hook frameworks in priority order:

1. **Husky** — `package.json` containing `"husky"` in `devDependencies`, OR `.husky/` directory exists
2. **pre-commit** — `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists
3. **Lefthook** — `lefthook.yml` or `.lefthook.yml` exists

For the first framework found:

1. **Record framework name** — `husky`, `pre-commit`, or `lefthook`
2. **List hook names** — parse the config to extract registered hooks (e.g., `lint-staged`, `commitlint`, `prettier --check`)
3. **Write to** `code_quality.pre_commit`:

```yaml
code_quality:
  pre_commit:
    framework: husky
    hooks:
      - lint-staged
      - commitlint
```

**If no pre-commit framework is found**, write null/empty defaults:
```yaml
code_quality:
  pre_commit:
    framework: null
    hooks: []
```

##### Step 3: Code Snippet Extraction

Select 2–3 representative source files that demonstrate the project's coding patterns. Prefer:
- An entry point (e.g., `main.kt`, `index.ts`, `app.py`, `App.swift`)
- A service or repository file (business logic)
- A component or view file (if UI exists)

For each selected file, extract an **annotated pattern** — NOT verbatim file content:

```yaml
code_quality:
  code_snippets:
    - path: src/services/UserService.kt
      pattern: repository-pattern
      annotation: "Uses constructor-injected repository with suspend functions; returns Result<T> wrapper"
      lines: "12-45"
    - path: src/components/Dashboard.tsx
      pattern: react-component
      annotation: "Functional component with useQuery hook; follows container/presenter split"
      lines: "1-38"
```

Each snippet entry must have:
- `path` — relative file path
- `pattern` — short pattern name (e.g., `repository-pattern`, `react-component`, `fastapi-router`)
- `annotation` — 1–2 sentence description of what the pattern demonstrates
- `lines` — line range showing the representative section (keep under 40 lines)

##### Step 4: Test-First Heuristic Signals

Collect 5 signal types that indicate whether the project follows test-first practices. These are **data only** — collected here, consumed by the developer-discovery story (Phase 2b-ii) for smart defaults.

| Signal | How to detect | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **co_located_tests** | Test files adjacent to source (e.g., `UserService.test.ts` next to `UserService.ts`) | `true` / `false` |
| **test_before_source** | Compare git timestamps: do test files predate or match source file creation? Sample 3–5 pairs via `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%aI -- <file>` | `true` / `false` / `inconclusive` |
| **test_runner_in_precommit** | Pre-commit hooks include a test runner (e.g., `jest`, `pytest`, `gradle test`) | `true` / `false` |
| **bdd_keywords** | Source or test files contain BDD keywords: `describe`, `it`, `given`, `when`, `then`, `Feature:`, `Scenario:` | `true` / `false` |
| **test_absence** | No test files found at all (from Phase 2 test infrastructure scan) | `true` / `false` |

Write to `code_quality.test_first_signals`:

```yaml
code_quality:
  test_first_signals:
    co_located_tests: false
    test_before_source: inconclusive
    test_runner_in_precommit: true
    bdd_keywords: true
    test_absence: false
```

##### Step 5: Idempotent Merge Logic

When Phase 2b-iii runs on a project that already has `code_quality` data:

1. **Read existing** `code_quality` section from `project-profile.yaml`
2. **Match linters by name** — if a linter entry with the same `name` exists, preserve the existing entry (it may have been manually edited)
3. **Append new** — any newly detected linter not already present gets appended
4. **Never remove** — entries in the existing file that are NOT re-detected are kept (user may have added them manually)
5. **Same logic** applies to `formatters[]`, `pre_commit.hooks[]`, and `code_snippets[]` (match snippets by `path`)
6. **Scalar fields** (`pre_commit.framework`, `test_first_signals.*`) — overwrite with latest detection, unless existing value was manually changed (check for a `# manual` comment annotation)

This ensures `kickoff` can be re-run safely without losing manual curation.

#### Phase 2b-iv: Cross-Cutting Concern Auto-Generation

Silently auto-generate project-specific cross-cutting concerns from the discovered tech stack. No interactive review gate — write the file and show a summary.

<!-- DATA CONTRACT: Writes to .pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml → concerns: [] -->
<!-- Default: concerns contain at minimum the 'documentation' concern -->

##### Step 1: Map Tech Stack to Template

Read `tech_stack` from `.pHive/project-profile.yaml` (populated in Phase 2). Map the discovered stack to a concern template file in `hive/references/examples/`:

| Tech Stack Signal | Template File |
|-------------------|---------------|
| KMP, Kotlin Multiplatform, Compose Multiplatform, Android + iOS | `cross-cutting-concerns.mobile-app.yaml` |
| React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte | *(no template — web)* |
| Express, FastAPI, Django, Rails, Spring | *(no template — API)* |
| CLI, argparse, cobra, clap | *(no template — CLI)* |

Detection logic:
1. Read `tech_stack.frameworks[]` and `tech_stack.languages[]` from project profile
2. If any framework or language matches mobile indicators (KMP, `kotlin-multiplatform`, `compose-multiplatform`, Android, iOS, Swift + Kotlin together, React Native, Flutter) → use `cross-cutting-concerns.mobile-app.yaml`
3. If no template file matches → fall through to Step 3 (graceful fallback)

##### Step 2: Generate Concerns from Template

If a matching template was found:

1. **Read the template** YAML from `hive/references/examples/{template-file}`
2. **Read existing** `.pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml` (may already have concerns from prior runs or manual edits)
3. **Idempotent merge** using the following algorithm:
   - Parse both files into concern lists, keyed by `id`
   - For each concern in the **template**:
     - If a concern with the same `id` exists in the **state file** → **keep the state file version** (it may have manual edits)
     - If the concern `id` is new (not in state file) → **append** it to the state file
   - For each concern in the **state file** that is NOT in the template → **preserve** it (user added it manually)
   - The `documentation` concern (default) is always preserved — never removed
4. **Write** the merged result to `.pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml`
5. **Count** how many new concerns were added (template entries not previously in state file)

##### Step 3: Graceful Fallback (No Template)

If no template matches the detected tech stack:

1. Ensure `.pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml` exists with at least the `documentation` concern:
   ```yaml
   concerns:
     - id: documentation
       name: Documentation Updates
       description: >
         When a story changes user-facing behavior, workflow steps, or configuration,
         corresponding documentation must be updated.
       applies_when: >
         Story modifies workflows, schemas, directory structure, configuration files,
         or adds/removes/renames reference documents
       planning_prompt: >
         Which documentation files reference the behavior this story changes?
         List each doc and what section needs updating.
       implementation_checklist:
         - "All docs referencing changed behavior identified"
         - "Affected sections updated to reflect new behavior"
         - "No stale references to old behavior remain"
   ```
2. If the file already exists with concerns, do not modify it — just proceed to summary

##### Step 4: Output Summary

Print a single summary line (no interactive prompt, no review gate):

- **Template matched:** `"Auto-generated N concerns for {stack}. Edit at .pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml."`
  - Where `N` is the count of newly added concerns (0 if all already existed from a prior run)
  - Where `{stack}` is the matched template name (e.g., "mobile-app")
- **No template:** `"No concern templates found for {stack}. Using 'documentation' default. Edit at .pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml."`
  - Where `{stack}` is the detected primary framework/language (e.g., "react", "fastapi")

This summary is informational only — kickoff continues to the next phase regardless.

##### Step 5: Idempotent Re-Run Safety

When Phase 2b-iv runs on a project that already has `.pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml`:

1. **Never remove** existing concerns — they may have been manually curated
2. **Never overwrite** an existing concern's fields — the user may have customized `applies_when`, `planning_prompt`, or checklist items
3. **Only append** template concerns whose `id` is not already present
4. **Re-running produces identical output** if no new concerns need adding (N=0 in summary)

#### Phase 2b Data Flow Summary

| Sub-phase | Target File | Target Section |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 2b-i Integration Preflight | project-profile.yaml | `integrations` |
| 2b-ii Developer Discovery | hive.config.yaml | `developer` |
| 2b-iii Code Quality & Linter Detection | project-profile.yaml | `code_quality` (linters, formatters, pre_commit, code_snippets, test_first_signals), `project_maturity` |
| 2b-iv Cross-Cutting Concern Auto-Generation | .pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml | `concerns` |
| 1b Ship Target Elicitation | project-profile.yaml | `ship_target` |

---

### Phase 3: Synthesize Project Profile

Write a structured project profile to `.pHive/project-profile.yaml`. This is what all Hive agents read before starting work.

```yaml
project_name: "{name}"
type: brownfield
discovered: "{ISO 8601}"
source: "CLAUDE.md + codebase scan"

ship_target:
  kind: app-store | vercel | github-release | npm | custom
  command: "<shell command>" # required only when kind == custom
  notes: "<optional human note, e.g. which Vercel project / npm scope>"

north_star:
  # Written during Phase 3b Discovery Questions (both brownfield and greenfield).
  # Fields set to `unknown` when operator skips. Block omitted only for pre-existing
  # profiles written before this schema version (consumers must tolerate absence).
  goal: "stated product goal or unknown"
  audience: "who this is for or unknown"
  expected_scale: "concurrent user expectation or unknown"
  pain_points: "major pain points or unknown"
  success: "what success looks like or unknown"  # optional follow-up; omit if skipped
  avoid: "what to avoid or unknown"              # optional follow-up; omit if skipped
```

### Phase 3b: Discovery Questions

After Phase 3 writes `.pHive/project-profile.yaml`, run the Discovery Questions step to capture the `north_star` block. This step applies to **both brownfield and greenfield** projects. It is **non-blocking** — every question is individually skippable and kickoff MUST NOT hard-fail if all are skipped.

#### Adaptive question set

Before asking, check what current-state discovery already surfaced. Do NOT re-ask items already answered:

| # | Question | Field | Skip if already captured |
|---|----------|-------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Who is this for? (audience) | `audience` | Users/personas identified in current-state discovery |
| 2 | How many concurrent users are you expecting? (scale) | `expected_scale` | Load/infra context already captured |
| 3 | What is the overall goal of the product? | `goal` | Rarely redundant — ask unless product-vision doc was read and summarized |
| 4 | What are your major pain points right now? | `pain_points` | Always ask — operational pain is not derivable from tech-stack scans |

After the 4 core questions, offer 2 optional follow-ups (clearly marked optional; skip on empty reply or explicit no):

| # | Question | Field |
|---|----------|-------|
| 5 | What does success look like? *(optional)* | `success` |
| 6 | What should we avoid? *(optional)* | `avoid` |

#### Persistence rule

Write the `north_star` block to `.pHive/project-profile.yaml` at the end of Phase 3b. Use the canonical try/except pattern from `hive/lib/config.py:9-12` (`try: import yaml / except Exception: yaml = None`) — PyYAML is an optional third-party dependency, not stdlib. If PyYAML is unavailable, append the block as plain `key: value` lines rather than hard-failing:

- Answered questions: write the operator's answer verbatim (or a concise paraphrase).
- Skipped/deferred questions: write `unknown`.
- Optional follow-ups skipped: omit the field rather than writing `unknown`.
- Skip-all case: write the `north_star` block with all four core fields set to `unknown`. Do NOT omit the block when the operator engaged (even with all skips).
- **Hard-fail rule:** kickoff MUST continue normally after Phase 3b regardless of how many questions were skipped.

#### North-star summary and suggested next steps

After writing `north_star`, emit a summary to the operator:

```
**North Star captured**
Goal:      {goal}
Audience:  {audience}
Scale:     {expected_scale}
Pain:      {pain_points}
```

Omit any line whose value is `unknown`. Then emit **Suggested next steps** derived from the combined `north_star` + current-state profile:

- If `expected_scale` is answered and indicates high concurrency: suggest capacity planning / load testing stories.
- If `pain_points` are answered: suggest "address top pain point" as the first recommended story.
- If `goal` is answered: suggest alignment check — does the current architecture serve the stated goal?

Suggested next steps are informational output only — they do not create issues or trigger any downstream action.

#### north_star schema (single source of truth)

The `north_star` block schema is defined here as the single authoritative source. Consumers of `north_star` MUST tolerate the block being absent entirely (pre-existing profiles written before Phase 3b was added).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `goal` | string | yes (core) | Overall product goal; `unknown` if skipped |
| `audience` | string | yes (core) | Primary users/personas; `unknown` if skipped |
| `expected_scale` | string | yes (core) | Concurrent user expectation; `unknown` if skipped |
| `pain_points` | string | yes (core) | Major current pain points; `unknown` if skipped |
| `success` | string | no (optional) | What success looks like; omit field if follow-up skipped |
| `avoid` | string | no (optional) | What to avoid; omit field if follow-up skipped |

#### tech_stack reader: tolerant of both shapes

Any reader that consumes `tech_stack` from `project-profile.yaml` MUST tolerate both the flat-list shape (`tech_stack: [node, bash, python]`) and the nested-object shape (`tech_stack: {languages: [...], frameworks: [...], ...}`). Normalize to a flat language list before use — do NOT rewrite the profile field:

```python
def resolve_languages(tech_stack):
    """Tolerate flat-list and nested tech_stack shapes. Normalize to lowercase list."""
    if isinstance(tech_stack, list):
        return [str(x).lower() for x in tech_stack]
    if isinstance(tech_stack, dict):
        langs = tech_stack.get("languages") or []
        return [str(x).lower() for x in langs]
    return []
```

This normalization is the **reference pattern** for all tech_stack consumers. The LSP suggestion reader (`hive/references/lsp-suggestions.md`) implements the same logic under `get_tech_stack_languages(profile)` with a profile-dict signature — the two are aligned implementations, not a shared import. Never hard-fail on an unexpected shape — return `[]` and degrade gracefully.

### Phase 4: hive.config.yaml

Create `hive.config.yaml` in the project root. This is Hive-specific config — NOT a duplicate of CLAUDE.md.

**What goes in hive.config.yaml:**
- Hive workflow settings (methodology, retry attempts, model tiers)
- Task tracking config (`task_tracking.adapter` + adapter-specific keys; see "Loading the task-tracking adapter" below)
- Quality gate thresholds
- Token budgets

**What stays in CLAUDE.md:**
- Build/test/lint commands
- Code conventions and rules
- Architecture decisions
- Project-specific instructions for Claude

**Never duplicate CLAUDE.md content in hive.config.yaml.**

### Loading the task-tracking adapter

When `task_tracking.adapter` is configured (`github` | `linear` | a filesystem
path to a custom adapter), Hive loads the adapter via the dispatch module.
Skills, hooks, and the orchestrator should reach trackers exclusively through
this surface — direct imports of `hive/adapters/<vendor>/index.ts` are
reserved for adapter tests.

```typescript
import { TaskTrackingDispatch } from "hive/lib/task-tracking-dispatch/index.ts";

const dispatch = new TaskTrackingDispatch();
await dispatch.load(config.task_tracking);

if (!dispatch.hasAdapter) {
  // gate_mode=warning -> dispatch.invoke() returns NO_ADAPTER and emits the
  //                      no-adapter telemetry event; callers route to skip.
  // gate_mode=hard    -> dispatch.invoke() returns NO_ADAPTER (terminal);
  //                      callers should halt the operation.
  // No skill-side branching on adapter vendor is needed — the dispatch
  // module owns gate_mode behavior + telemetry.
}
```

Terminal failures from a loaded adapter (auth, timeout, internal error,
operation-unsupported) under `gate_mode: warning` are recorded as
`prose-runbook-fallback` events at `<state_dir>/metrics/events/` —
per-occurrence, one event per terminal call. The events feed migration
dashboards tracking moves away from the legacy prose-runbook path.

See `hive/lib/task-tracking-dispatch/README.md` for the full dispatch
surface (capability inspection, error codes, cache semantics). This
replaces the legacy prose-runbook reference path; see Epic C
(`task-tracking-adapter-abi`) for migration context.

### Phase 4b: Scaffold CONTEXT.md (domain glossary)

Bootstrap `.pHive/CONTEXT.md` — the project's single-file domain glossary. Schema spec: [`hive/references/context-md-schema.md`](context-md-schema.md). One file, single source — NOT a tree.

**Brownfield path** (codebase already exists):
- Spawn the **researcher** persona with a bounded brief: "Inventory the project's domain vocabulary from CLAUDE.md, README, top-level directories, and the most-cited terms in `hive/references/`. Return 10–20 candidate terms with 1-sentence definitions."
- Pass the inventory to the **technical-writer** persona, who instantiates the schema and writes `.pHive/CONTEXT.md` (sections: Terminology, Key paths, Conventions, Canonical references). Length target <200 lines.
- The user reviews the seeded glossary in the onboarding report (Phase 6) and may edit before Hive proceeds.

**Greenfield path** (no codebase yet):
- Write an empty scaffold to `.pHive/CONTEXT.md` with the schema's section headers and a one-line note ("Populate as the project's vocabulary stabilizes — see [`hive/references/context-md-schema.md`](../hive/references/context-md-schema.md) for content rules.").
- Discovery brief vocabulary may be promoted into CONTEXT.md by the user later.

**Backfill path** (existing kickoff, CONTEXT.md missing):
- Detect: `.pHive/project-profile.yaml` exists AND `.pHive/CONTEXT.md` does NOT.
- Prompt the user opt-in (headless: phase `4b` — see Headless Mode above): "CONTEXT.md (domain glossary) was added in Hive 2.0. Want me to scaffold it now from your existing codebase? [yes / skip]". Skip leaves the project unmodified — CONTEXT.md is silent-on-absence per skill-prelude contract, so nothing breaks.
- On yes: run the brownfield path above.

**Idempotent:** if `.pHive/CONTEXT.md` already exists with non-empty content, skip Phase 4b entirely. Do not overwrite a maintained glossary.

### Phase 5: Initialize Hive State

- Create `.pHive/cycle-state/` directory
- Create `.pHive/epics/` directory
- Create `.pHive/insights/` directory (staging area for agent insights)
- Create `.pHive/test-baseline/{project}/` if test swarm will be used
- Create `.pHive/test-artifacts/` directory (screenshots, logs, results from test swarm)
- Create `~/.claude/hive/memories/` with subdirectories for each agent in the roster: frontend-developer, backend-developer, researcher, technical-writer, tester, reviewer, architect, analyst, tpm, ui-designer, team-lead, pair-programmer, peer-validator, test-architect, test-scout, test-worker, test-inspector, test-sentinel, orchestrator
- Create `.pHive/team-memories/` directory (project-scoped team collective memories)
- Create `.pHive/teams/` directory (loadable team configs)
- Ensure `~/.claude/hive/kg.sqlite` schema is initialized by running the SQLite DDL from `hive/references/knowledge-graph-schema.md#sqlite-bootstrap` on every kickoff. The DDL is idempotent, so re-running is safe.
- **Project registry (system-level).** If this is a brownfield kickoff and the user wants this project's decision history visible to the cross-project meta-signal feeds, append an entry to `~/.claude/hive/projects.yaml` and run `node scripts/kg-bootstrap-from-projects.js --apply` (default is `--dry-run`; pass `--apply` to actually write). The registry schema and bootstrap behavior are documented in `hive/references/system-config.md`. The registry is system-scoped (per machine, per user) — not per-project — because the KG itself is global at `~/.claude/hive/kg.sqlite`. Skip this step entirely if the user has not opted into multi-project KG seeding; the meta-signal feeds degrade gracefully when only the local project's triples are present.
- Start ChromaDB sidecar if not already running: `hive/lib/chromadb-wrapper.js` is the JS-side wrapper, but the ChromaDB Python process must be started separately (e.g., `chroma run --path ~/.claude/hive/chromadb/`). Check with `isAvailable()`. **ChromaDB is optional** — if not installed or not started, all memory reads fall back to L1+L0 silently. Agents are not blocked by ChromaDB absence.
- Run per-agent memory migration (idempotent — safe to run every kickoff):
  - For each agent, check `skills/hive/agents/memories/{agent}/` for `.md` files
  - Copy files that don't already exist at `~/.claude/hive/memories/{agent}/`
  - Skip files that already exist at the system path (don't overwrite)
  - Log: `Migrated: N files, Skipped: M files`
  - See `references/agent-memory-schema.md` → "Migration from old path" for full procedure

### Phase 5b: Generate Team Configs

Based on the project discovery from phases 1-4, generate team config files:

1. Identify project domains from directory structure (frontend dirs, backend dirs, test dirs, infra dirs)
2. Match domains to roster agents (frontend dir → frontend-developer, backend dir → backend-developer, etc.)
3. Generate domain restrictions based on actual directory paths discovered
4. Set tech_stack from discovered technologies
5. **Integration-driven tool access** — read `project-profile.yaml → integrations` and configure agent tool access:
   - If **Maestro** detected → add `tool_access: [maestro]` to test agents (tester, test-worker, test-architect)
   - If **Frame0** detected → add `tool_access: [frame0]` to UI agents (ui-designer, frontend-developer)
   - If **mobile-mcp** detected → add `tool_access: [mobile-mcp]` to mobile agents
   - If **codex** detected → add `tool_access: [codex]` to reviewer agent
   - Only grant tool access for integrations that are actually detected — agents should not reference unavailable tools
6. **Linter domain restrictions** — read `project-profile.yaml → code_quality.linters[]` and configure code agents:
   - For each detected linter, add `lint_command` to code agent context (frontend-developer, backend-developer, pair-programmer)
   - Example: if `eslint` detected with command `npx eslint .`, add to the agent's `context.lint_commands[]`
   - This enables code agents to run linters before submitting PRs
7. **Developer methodology** — read `hive.config.yaml → developer` and `execution.default_methodology`:
   - Set team `methodology` field from `execution.default_methodology` (e.g., `tdd`, `classic`)
   - Propagate `developer.pr_style` and `developer.review_depth` into reviewer agent context
   - Propagate `developer.commit_granularity` into all code agent contexts
8. Write team config(s) to `.pHive/teams/{team-name}.yaml`
9. For large projects, generate multiple specialized teams (e.g., `api-team`, `mobile-team`)
10. Present configs in the onboarding report for user review

See `references/team-config-schema.md` for the full format.

## Step 2B: Greenfield — Product Kickoff

For a new project starting from scratch.

**Goal:** Go from idea to implementable stories through a structured planning pipeline.

**Process:**

1. **Product Discovery (analyst greenfield-facilitation mode)**

   Delegate to the **analyst** agent in greenfield-facilitation mode for deep product exploration. The analyst conducts a structured Socratic conversation that replaces inline brainstorming.

   - Read the persona: `hive/agents/analyst.md` — the "Greenfield Discovery Facilitation" section is the procedure
   - Brief schema reference: `hive/references/document-templates/greenfield-discovery-brief.md`
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` has a description, pass it as input context
   - The analyst facilitates a 7-area discovery conversation: problem space, target users, competitive landscape, differentiators, success metrics, MVP boundaries, and technical constraints
   - Output: structured **Product Discovery Brief** written to `.pHive/planning/product-discovery-brief.md`
   - The user validates the brief before proceeding to Step 2
   - The discovery brief feeds directly into Step 2 (Product Brief) as structured input

   **1a. Integration Preflight**

   Run the same integration detection as brownfield Phase 2b-i. CLI tools (`linearis`, `frame0`, `codex`, `maestro`) and MCP servers (`firecrawl`, `context7`, `posthog`, `firebase`, `mobile-mcp`) are system-level — they exist regardless of whether a codebase exists. Vaults (`obsidian`) are also system-level.

   - Detect available integrations using the same logic as brownfield (check `which` for CLIs, check MCP server configs for servers, check vault paths)
   - Write results to `.pHive/project-profile.yaml → integrations`
   - Results inform which Hive capabilities are available during execution (e.g., Frame0 for wireframes, Maestro for E2E tests)

   **1b. Developer Discovery (Static Defaults)**

   Elicit developer preferences for PR workflow, commit style, and review expectations — identical to brownfield Phase 2b-ii elicitation. However, greenfield discovery uses **static defaults only**:

   - **No test-first heuristic signals** — there is no codebase to analyze
   - **No linter detection** — there are no config files to scan
   - **No code snippet extraction** — there is no existing code
   - All smart-default fields (`test_first_signals`, `code_quality`) are skipped entirely
   - Elicitation still asks the developer about: `pr_style`, `commit_granularity`, `review_depth`, `methodology`, and `notes`
   - Write results to `hive.config.yaml → developer` and `execution.default_methodology`

2. **Product Brief**
   - Synthesize into structured brief
   - Sections: Problem, Target Users, Core Features (P0/P1/P2), Success Metrics, Scope Boundaries
   - Write to `.pHive/planning/product-brief.md`
   - Present for user approval before proceeding

3. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
   - Expand brief into detailed requirements
   - Each requirement: description, user value, acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
   - Write to `.pHive/planning/prd.md`
   - Present for user approval

4. **Architecture**
   - Architect agent: tech stack, components, API contracts, data model
   - Decisions with alternatives considered and rationale
   - Write to `.pHive/planning/architecture.md`
   - Present for user approval

   **4a. Cross-Cutting Concern Auto-Generation (from Architecture Choices)**

   After the user approves the architecture, silently auto-generate cross-cutting concerns. This follows the same generation logic as brownfield Phase 2b-iv, but the input is the **chosen architecture stack** (from `.pHive/planning/architecture.md`), not a discovered codebase.

   - Read the chosen tech stack from the architecture document (frameworks, languages, patterns)
   - Map to a concern template in `hive/references/examples/` using the same mapping table as brownfield Phase 2b-iv Step 1
   - If a template matches: idempotent merge into `.pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml` (same algorithm as brownfield — match by `id`, preserve existing, append new)
   - If no template matches: ensure `documentation` default concern exists
   - Print summary: `"Auto-generated N concerns for {stack}. Edit at .pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml."`

   **4b. Linter & Formatter Setup Recommendation**

   Since no codebase exists, there are no linter/formatter configs to detect. Instead, **recommend** setup based on the chosen tech stack:

   - Map the chosen language/framework to recommended linters and formatters:
     - JavaScript/TypeScript → ESLint + Prettier
     - Python → Ruff (linter + formatter)
     - Kotlin → detekt + ktlint
     - Swift → SwiftLint + SwiftFormat
     - Go → golangci-lint + gofmt (built-in)
     - Rust → clippy + rustfmt (built-in)
   - Present as a recommendation (not a detection result): `"Recommended for {stack}: {linter} + {formatter}. Configure these early to establish code quality standards."`
   - Do **not** write to `project-profile.yaml → code_quality` — there are no detected configs to record. The developer will configure these tools when they scaffold the project.

5. **Epics & Stories**
   - Decompose PRD into epics and stories via `/plugin-hive:plan`
   - Apply agent-ready checklist to every story
   - Write to `.pHive/epics/`

6. **Initialize Cycle State**
   - Create `.pHive/cycle-state/{epic-id}.yaml` with all decisions from steps 2-4

7. **Present Kickoff Summary**
   ```
