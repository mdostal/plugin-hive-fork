# Predicate Grammar Reference (hde-3a)

The Hive DAG executor evaluates `when:` predicates and a single
`trigger_rule` policy at every step. This document is the canonical
reference for the predicate language and the failure model. It is
deliberately small — adding to it is an **epic-level** change, not a
story-level patch.

## Cultural lock — grammar additions require an epic

> Adding ANY operator, literal type, or evaluator behaviour to this
> grammar requires an epic, not a story.

Argo Workflows shipped a similar predicate language with `==`, `!=`,
`&&`, `||` and a small set of escape hatches. Subsequent quarters added
regex (`=~`), arithmetic (`+ - * /`), function calls (`asInt`,
`success()`, `failure()`), parens, and a generic expression engine. The
language fragmented into "old syntax" and "new syntax", workflows split
across both, and the maintainers spent two years on a migration program
to unify them. We refuse that debt.

The grammar lives behind a high-friction door on purpose. New operators
go through epic review with explicit migration cost analysis even if
they look "tiny".

## Lock summary

* **Grammar lock (user-gate Q5 = `strict_archon`):** strict-Archon
  predicate grammar; no parens, regex, status fns, arithmetic, or
  function calls.
* **trigger_rule lock (user-gate Q3 =
  `skip_propagation_none_failed_min_one_success`):** the only
  supported policy is `none_failed_min_one_success`. Failure does NOT
  cascade as failure under this policy — failed upstreams convert to
  SKIP for the candidate node.
* **Fail-closed:** invalid predicate text and missing fields produce
  False + a `predicate_evaluated` warning event. Predicate failures
  NEVER abort the run.

## Grammar (formal)

```ebnf
expr        = or_expr ;
or_expr     = and_expr , { "||" , and_expr } ;
and_expr    = comparison , { "&&" , comparison } ;
comparison  = atom , [ comp_op , atom ] ;
comp_op     = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" ;
atom        = literal | dotpath ;
literal     = "true" | "false" | "null" | int | float ;
dotpath     = "$" , ident , ( "." , ident )+ ;
ident       = letter , { letter | digit | "_" | "-" } ;
int         = [ "-" ] , digit+ ;
float       = [ "-" ] , digit+ , "." , digit+ ;
```

Whitespace between tokens is insignificant.

## Operators (8 total)

| Operator | Example | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `==` | `$step.output.signal == true` | Strict equality (type-checked; `true == 1` is False) |
| `!=` | `$step.output.verdict != null` | Strict inequality |
| `<` | `$step.output.attempts < 3` | Numeric less-than |
| `<=` | `$step.output.attempts <= 3` | Numeric less-or-equal |
| `>` | `$step.output.attempts > 0` | Numeric greater-than |
| `>=` | `$step.output.attempts >= 1` | Numeric greater-or-equal |
| `&&` | `$a.output.x == true && $b.output.y == true` | Logical AND (short-circuits) |
| `\|\|` | `$a.output.x == true \|\| $b.output.y == true` | Logical OR (short-circuits) |

### Precedence

`&&` binds tighter than `||`. There are **no parentheses** to override
this. `a && b || c` parses as `(a && b) || c` and stays that way.
Right-side associativity for `||`/`&&` is left-to-right.

If a predicate genuinely needs `(a || b) && c`, restructure it as two
predicates on two steps, or escalate to an epic to add parentheses.

## Disallowed (will fail-closed to skip)

The lexer rejects each of these and the predicate is treated as False:

* parentheses: `( ... )`
* regex match: `=~`
* status fns: `success()`, `failure()`
* arithmetic: `+`, `-` (binary), `*`, `/`
* any function call: `len(...)`, `asInt(...)`, etc.
* string literals (`"approve"`) — no string literal type today;
  string equality is fail-closed False.

## Field references — `$nodeId.output.field`

Every value reference takes the form `$<node-id>.<segment>(.<segment>)*`.
The first segment SHOULD be `output` so the dot-path resolves into the
upstream node's `outputs` map. Deeper paths are permitted for nested
output structures (`$step.output.metrics.signal`).

### Risk #13 lock — `change_verdict` vs `cycle_verdict`

Predicates that reference a step's change-level verdict MUST use
`$step.output.change_verdict` explicitly. Bare `$step.output.verdict`
is **undefined under this contract** — no field by that name is
guaranteed to exist on the upstream output, and the evaluator returns
False fail-closed if it doesn't.

The same step typically also publishes `$step.output.cycle_verdict`
(loop-level decision) and the two are NOT interchangeable. Always pick
the specific name; never rely on a generic `verdict`.

`change_verdict` is a string-valued field (`"approve"`, `"reject"`,
`"needs_changes"`, …). The current grammar (Q5 lock) does NOT support
string literals (see "Disallowed" above), so you cannot route on
`change_verdict`'s value directly under a `when:` predicate. Two
sanctioned patterns:

1. **Existence-only routing.** Compare against `null` to detect
   whether the field is set at all; route follow-on work behind the
   gate, then resolve the value in the agent step's prose.

   ```yaml
   # Run reviewer-followup whenever a verdict was emitted at all
   when: "$verifier.output.change_verdict != null"
   ```

2. **Companion boolean field.** When value-level routing IS required,
   have the upstream emit a sibling boolean (e.g.
   `change_verdict_blocking`) alongside `change_verdict` and bind
   `when:` to the boolean. Document the new field in the upstream's
   `output_format` block.

```yaml
# Wrong — bool vs string, fail-closed False every time (no string literals)
when: "$verifier.output.change_verdict == true"

# Wrong — bare `verdict` is not a defined field
when: "$verifier.output.verdict == true"
```

A grammar extension to admit string literals is an epic-level decision
(Q5 lock), not a story-level patch.

## Fail-closed semantics

The evaluator returns **False** in every degenerate case:

| Case | Result | Telemetry |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Empty/whitespace predicate | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `fail_closed: true` |
| Disallowed construct (parens, regex, …) | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `fail_closed: true` |
| Trailing tokens after expression | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `fail_closed: true` |
| Dot-path references unknown node | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `result: false` |
| Dot-path field missing on upstream output | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `result: false` |
| Numeric comparison with non-numeric operand | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `result: false` |
| Strict-equality type mismatch (`bool` vs `int`) | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `result: false` |
| Both operands legitimately unequal | False | `predicate_evaluated` with `result: false` |

The walker emits the `predicate_evaluated` event before deciding to
skip the step. Run telemetry (`events/<run_id>.jsonl`) is the audit
surface — predicate failures are visible there, not in stderr.

## Boolean convergence signals (`skip_when` on unrolled loops)

Loop templates (`loop_config.feature` + `convergence_signal`) are expanded at
load time into round copies by the unroll expander — see
[`loop-unroll-migration.md`](loop-unroll-migration.md). Each round `k > 1`
carries a `skip_when:` predicate that short-circuits the loop once an earlier
round converged. Convergence **must ride a boolean output**, not prose.

**The pattern.** The loop body's reviewer/tester step declares a boolean output
(the `convergence_signal`) and the expander emits, for round `k`, an OR-chain
over **all** prior rounds (a converged-latch — a `k-1`-only reference fails to
short-circuit past the first skipped round):

```
$<producer>__r1.output.<signal> == true || … || $<producer>__r{k-1}.output.<signal> == true
```

Canonical signals: `review_passed` (review_converge), `tests_green`
(tdd_red_green), `behavior_satisfied` (bdd_converge), `coverage_satisfied`
(test_swarm). Each is declared `type: json` on the producer and set to a real
`true`/`false` boolean — never a string.

**Why boolean, not prose — the trap this epic fixed.** The grammar accepts only
`true|false|null|int|float` literals and dot-path field refs (see *Disallowed*
above). A **prose** convergence predicate (e.g. `review passed`) is not
grammar-legal, so it can never evaluate `true`. Under `skip_when`'s fail-closed
direction (below) that means the loop would never short-circuit — every round
re-runs to the ceiling. Convergence therefore rides a declared boolean the
reviewer/tester step **must emit**; if it doesn't, the loop simply runs
`max_rounds` and the terminal gate decides.

**`skip_when` is fail-closed-to-RUN — the INVERSE of `when:`.** `when:`
fail-closes to **False** (skip the step). `skip_when` fail-closes to **False for
the skip decision, i.e. RUN the node**: an empty, unparseable, or missing-field
`skip_when` predicate runs the node rather than skipping it. This is deliberate —
a loop round that has **not** yet converged must never be silently dropped. So a
prose/garbage `skip_when` runs (does not skip); only a genuinely-`true`
grammar-legal predicate skips.

| `skip_when` case | Skip? | Effect |
|------------------|-------|--------|
| Empty / missing | No | Node runs (round 1 always runs) |
| Parse failure (prose) | No | Node runs — non-converged round never dropped |
| Dot-path field missing (skipped prior round) | No | Node runs — OR-chain over ALL prior rounds covers gaps |
| Grammar-legal predicate → `true` | **Yes** | Round skipped (an earlier round converged) |

The terminal gate after the loop reads the **last successful round**'s signal, so
an early-converged run integrates while a never-converged run (all rounds ran,
signal false at the ceiling) still blocks — preserving the bug-#26 hard-block.

## trigger_rule — `none_failed_min_one_success`

The single supported policy. Applied at multi-upstream joins
(`depends_on` length > 1).

| Upstream statuses | Decision |
|-------------------|----------|
| At least one COMPLETED | RUN |
| Zero COMPLETED, any FAILED | SKIP (no failure cascade) |
| All SKIPPED | SKIP |
| All PENDING/RUNNING | SKIP (defensive — should not occur in topological order) |

### Why no cascade

A FAILED upstream feeding into a join skips the downstream rather than
failing it. This pairs with per-input `optional` bindings: if the
join needs the failed upstream's output, it can either declare the
binding `optional: true` (gets `None`) or be `optional: true` itself
(skipped silently). The hard-fail path is reserved for non-optional,
non-multi-upstream cases.

Single-upstream nodes do NOT pass through trigger_rule — the legacy
hde-2 behaviour (per-input `optional` lets the binding receive `None`
on upstream failure) is preserved unchanged.

### Why no other policies

`all_success`, `any_success`, `always`, and `one_failed` are NOT
implemented. They each carry semantic gotchas (`all_success` cascades
failures; `always` runs even on cancellation; `one_failed` requires a
notion of "at least one ran") that warrant epic-level evaluation.

## Telemetry contract

Routing emits one `predicate_evaluated` event per `when:` evaluation
with payload:

```json
{
  "expr": "$step.output.signal == true",
  "result": false,
  "fail_closed": true,         // present only on parse failures
  "reason": "..."              // present only on parse failures
}
```

Multi-upstream joins emit `node_skipped` with payload:

```json
{
  "reason": "trigger_rule:none_failed_min_one_success",
  "upstream_statuses": {"a": "completed", "b": "failed"}
}
```

`node_skipped` is also emitted for `when:` skips with
`reason: "when_predicate_false"`.
