# Step 4: Implementation

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- Read this entire step file before taking any action
- Implement ONLY the approved proposals from step 3 — no scope creep
- Read each target file before writing to it — even for new files, check if it already exists
- NEVER remove more than 50% of a file's existing content in a single operation
- NEVER delete any file
- For additive changes: append or insert; do not replace existing content unless fixing a specific named error
- Track each change with file path, action type, and a brief description in the step's `changes_made` output

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

**Mode:** autonomous

**Authority model:** this step's only persistent output is the structured `changes_made` result returned to the workflow. Do NOT write cycle-state, ledger, envelope, or metrics-carrier files inline from this step. Downstream steps (evaluation, promotion, close) own any persistent control-plane writes and the orchestrator coordinates them via the workflow output graph, the B0 envelope contract (`.pHive/epics/meta-improvement-system/docs/b0-consumer-contract.md`), and the C1 runtime primitives (`hive/lib/metrics/`) per the meta-improvement-system epic.

Implement each approved proposal in priority order. Track changes in the implementation outputs as you go.

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES

**Inputs available:**
- `approved_proposals` JSON from step 3 (each with implementation_plan)
- Full codebase read/write access within charter domain

**NOT available:**
- User input
- Changes to files outside the charter domain
- Config file modifications

## YOUR TASK

Execute each approved proposal's implementation plan. Write new files, add sections, create memory entries. Track every change made in the implementation outputs.

## TASK SEQUENCE

### 1. Process proposals in priority order
For each approved proposal (highest priority first):

**Maintain working notes during execution.** For a multi-phase story, keep a running scratchpad at `.pHive/task-notes/{story-id}/` — record which proposals are done or blocked, decisions taken, and open questions so you stay coherent across phases. Read your own notes back when resuming. These notes are ephemeral working memory: WRITE-during-execution, DISCARD-at-story-close. They are NOT memory and are NOT a persistent control-plane output — they never enter insight staging or memory promotion (see `references/agent-memory-schema.md` → Ephemeral Working Memory), and they are exempt from the structured `changes_made` tracking above.

#### 1a. Re-read the target file(s)
Before making any change, read the current content of every file in the implementation plan. Confirm:
- The issue the proposal addresses is still present (it might have been fixed by a prior proposal in the same cycle)
- The proposed action won't conflict with existing content

#### 1b. Execute each implementation plan step
For `action: create`:
- Check the file doesn't already exist
- Write the new file following the appropriate schema (step-file-schema, agent-memory-schema, workflow-schema, etc.)

For `action: add_section`:
- Read current file content
- Identify the insertion point (end of file, after a specific section, etc.)
- Add the section without altering surrounding content

For `action: update_field`:
- Read current file content
- Update the specific named field only
- Leave all other content unchanged

For `action: add_entry`:
- Read current file content
- Append the new entry to the appropriate list or section

#### 1c. Track the change in the implementation report output
Immediately after each successful file write, add a structured entry to the `changes_made` output:
```yaml
- proposal_id: proposal-{N}
  action: {action type}
  file: {file path}
  description: {what was written / added / changed}
  status: done
```

### 2. Handle blocked proposals
If a proposal cannot be implemented as planned (target file has changed, dependency missing, content conflict):
- Record it as `status: blocked` with a reason
- Do NOT attempt a workaround — skip it cleanly
- Continue with remaining proposals

### 3. Produce implementation report
This report is the human-readable companion to the structured `changes_made` output.
```
## Implementation Report — Cycle {cycle_id}

Changes made: {N}
Blocked proposals: {N}

Changes:
  [done] {proposal_id} — {file}: {description}
  [blocked] {proposal_id} — {reason}
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] Each approved proposal attempted in priority order
- [ ] Each target file read before writing
- [ ] No existing file content removed beyond the minimum needed to fix the named issue
- [ ] Each completed change appears in the `changes_made` output
- [ ] Implementation report produced

## FAILURE MODES

- File write fails: log as blocked, continue with remaining proposals
- Content conflict (target section already exists or was added by a prior proposal): log as blocked with reason `already_exists`, skip
- Accidental scope creep: revert the change, record as blocked with reason `scope_creep`

## WHAT THIS STEP DOES NOT OWN

- Persistent cycle-state or ledger writes (close step / orchestrator own those per the rebuilt authority model)
- Envelope creation or updates (lifecycle library and promotion step own these — B0 §1 contract)
- Metrics-carrier emission (opt-in via kickoff; C2 emitters own this; Step 4 does not emit events)
- Test execution or validation (Step 5)
- Evaluation verdict (Step 6)
- Promotion or revert decisions (Step 7)
- Closure invariant checks (Step 8 close validator)

## NEXT STEP

**Gating:** Every proposal has a structured entry in the `changes_made` output — either a completed change OR a block record with a structured reason. An all-blocked cycle is a valid advance.
**Next:** Load `hive/workflows/steps/meta-team-cycle/step-05-testing.md`
**If gating fails:** Report which proposals have no entry in `changes_made` and why.
