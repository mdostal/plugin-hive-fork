# Step 3: Present Standup

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- Read this entire step file before taking any action
- Do NOT present raw YAML dumps — format everything into human-readable sections
- Do NOT omit failed or blocked stories — these are the most important items for the user
- Do NOT proceed past presentation — this step ends after the user has seen the report
- If there are no active epics, say so explicitly and proceed to planning phase

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

**Mode:** interactive (default) | non-interactive (when `args.format == "slack"`)

Format the combined state and memory data into a structured standup report. Present to the user.

**Format branching:**

- `args.format == "slack"` → emit the report as plain markdown (no ANSI escape codes, no color sequences, no bold/dim terminal formatting). Skip the "Ready for Planning?" prompt. Return immediately after printing the report — do NOT proceed to step 4 or beyond. This path is designed for cron capture and non-interactive pipeline use.
- `args.format == "default"` (or omitted) → standard interactive mode. Wait for user acknowledgment before proceeding. All ANSI formatting and interactive prompts apply as normal.

When rendering under `--format slack`, use markdown constructs only: `##`/`###` headings (no H1), `-` bullet lists, ` ``` ` fenced code blocks for tabular data. Do not emit terminal escape sequences. See `hive/references/standup-slack-format.md` for the full output spec.

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES

**Inputs available:**
- State reconstruction report from step 1
- Memory summary from step 2
- Cross-cutting concerns from step 2

**NOT available:**
- Story spec details (only IDs and statuses are known)
- External tracker live data (already captured in step 1 if adapter configured)

## YOUR TASK

Combine state reconstruction and memory summary into a single structured standup report and present it to the user.

## TASK SEQUENCE

### 1. Build the standup header
Include date, active epic count, and overall health indicator:
- GREEN: no failed/blocked stories, work can proceed
- YELLOW: some blocked stories but unblocked work is available
- RED: all remaining stories are blocked or failed

### 1b. Format overnight remote work section

If the step 1 report includes `overnight_pulls` with any commits, add this section at the very top of the standup output (above "Completed"):

```
### 🌙 Overnight
- Commits pulled: {N}
- [if meta_team_commits present]
  **Meta-team cycle `{cycle_id}` ran** — verdict: {passed|partial|poor}
  Read `.pHive/meta-team/morning-summary.md` for the full report.
  Top highlights:
    - {summary bullet 1}
    - {summary bullet 2}
    - {summary bullet 3}
  Deferred to next cycle: {count} findings
- [if non-meta-team commits present]
  Other remote commits: {subject list}
```

If a meta-team cycle ran, read `.pHive/meta-team/morning-summary.md` and pull out:
- The verdict line
- The "What Changed Tonight" top 3 items (condensed to one line each)
- The count of items under "What Was Found (Not Fixed This Cycle)"

If no overnight pulls occurred, skip this section entirely — do NOT add an empty "Overnight: nothing" placeholder.

If the pull was skipped (uncommitted local changes, merge conflict), surface this as a YELLOW warning at the top of the standup:
```
⚠ Overnight remote work NOT pulled: {skip reason}
  You have {N} commits waiting on origin/main. Handle local changes, then `git pull` before proceeding.
```

### 2. Format completed work section
List stories completed in previous sessions, grouped by epic:
```
### Completed
- [{epic-id}] {story-id}: {title} — completed {date}
```

### 3. Format in-progress work section
List stories that were started but not finished:
```
### In Progress
- [{epic-id}] {story-id}: {title}
  Last step: {step-name} ({status})
  Next step: {expected-next-step}
```

### 4. Format blocked and failed work section
This is the most critical section — present with clear action items:
```
### Blocked (needs resolution)
- [{epic-id}] {story-id}: {title}
  Blocker: {description}
  Since: {date}
  Action needed: {what the user needs to do}

### Failed (needs retry or decision)
- [{epic-id}] {story-id}: {title}
  Failure: {description from episode conclusions}
  Last attempt: {date}
  Options: retry | skip | redesign
```

### 5. Format dependency graph
Show the dependency relationships between remaining stories.

**Dependency Graph — legend:** `→` = depends on; `✗ blocked by` = blocked; `(independent)` = no dependencies. (Plain-text graph, not Mermaid — kept terminal-readable.)
```
### Dependency Graph
{story-A} → {story-B} → {story-C}
{story-D} (independent)
{story-E} ✗ blocked by {story-F}
```

### 6. Include relevant memories
Summarize key agent memories that affect today's work:
```
### Institutional Knowledge
- [{agent}] {memory-name}: {one-line summary}
```

### 7. Compute and include cost burn rate

Scan only the **completed** story markers in the **current epic(s)** for `tokens.cost_usd` — never the whole `.pHive/episodes/` tree, or unrelated epics and in-flight markers will inflate the total. Use Python (PyYAML — already a Hive dependency) when summation logic is needed:

```python
import yaml, pathlib

# epic_ids: the epic(s) this standup covers — do NOT glob all episodes.
total_cost = 0.0
for epic_id in epic_ids:
    for path in pathlib.Path(".pHive/episodes", epic_id).glob("**/*.yaml"):
        data = yaml.safe_load(path.read_text()) or {}
        if data.get("status") != "completed":
            continue  # skip in-flight / failed markers
        cost = (data.get("tokens") or {}).get("cost_usd")
        if cost is not None:
            total_cost += float(cost)
```

- Markers without `cost_usd` contribute zero — no error, no skip.
- If no markers have `cost_usd`, omit the burn-rate line (do not show `$0.00 / unknown`).
- When at least one marker has `cost_usd`, append this section to the standup report:

```
### Credit Burn Rate
  Session spend : $X.XXXX
  Credit pool   : {pool size from config, or "unknown"}
  Burn rate note: {e.g. "Est. N sessions remaining" or omit if pool unknown}
```

### 8. Present the full standup report
Output the complete report to the user. End with:
```
### Ready for Planning
{N} stories available for today's work. Proceed to planning? (yes / or provide specific story IDs)
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] Overnight section surfaced at the top of the standup when commits were pulled
- [ ] Meta-team cycle results highlighted when a meta-team cycle ran overnight
- [ ] Skipped-pull warning shown when local changes blocked the pull
- [ ] Standup report includes all five sections: completed, in-progress, blocked, failed, dependency graph
- [ ] Health indicator (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) is accurate based on story statuses
- [ ] Blocked and failed stories have clear action items
- [ ] Dependency graph shows which stories are available vs. blocked
- [ ] Relevant agent memories are summarized
- [ ] Credit burn-rate line shown when any completed marker carries `cost_usd`; omitted (not zero-printed) when none do
- [ ] Report is presented to the user (not just computed internally)

## FAILURE MODES

- Dumping raw YAML instead of formatted output — user cannot quickly parse status
- Omitting blocked stories — user proceeds to planning without resolving blockers, wasting a session
- Not showing the dependency graph — user may select stories whose dependencies are not met
- Presenting memories without filtering — irrelevant memories dilute the important ones

## NEXT STEP

**Gating (default format):** Standup report presented to user. User has acknowledged.
**Next (default format):** Load `workflows/steps/daily-ceremony/step-04-select-work.md`
**If gating fails:** If user requests changes to the report format or wants more detail on specific items, provide it before proceeding.

**Slack format:** After emitting the report, stop. Do NOT load step 4. The workflow terminates at this step.
