# Hive

> **Composable substrate for the agentic SDLC — user-directed, disciplined, kickoff to ship.**

A Claude Code plugin that turns your project into a coordinated swarm of AI specialists with the discipline of a real software team — planning, design, execution, code review, test. Built at [Firefly Events](https://ff.events) while shipping our own products. Open source.

## What is Hive?

Hive structures AI-assisted software development into a repeatable, team-like workflow. Instead of chatting with a single assistant, you get:

- **Specialized agents** (analyst, architect, developer, tester, reviewer, etc.) that collaborate on your behalf
- **Structured phases** from kickoff to ship with built-in quality gates
- **Persistent memory** so agents learn from past sessions and projects
- **Human-in-the-loop** checkpoints where your judgment matters most

Think of it as giving your Claude Code session the discipline and coordination of a small software team — without the overhead.

---

## Why use Hive?

If you've found that:
- AI coding assistants lose context on larger features
- You spend too much time re-explaining project details
- Testing and review feel ad-hoc or incomplete
- You want more reliable, repeatable results from AI-assisted work

...then Hive provides the scaffolding to make agentic development feel more like working with a competent team.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Prerequisites**
- Claude Code CLI v2.1+ ([install guide](https://claude.ai/code))
- Claude Code authentication: sign in normally, or use Anthropic's stored-secret flow if you want Claude Code to draw from your Anthropic subscription/API account

**2. Install**
```bash
# Inside any Claude Code session:
/plugin marketplace add firefly-events/plugin-hive
/plugin install plugin-hive@firefly-events/plugin-hive
```

**3. Initialize your project**
```bash
/hive:kickoff        # Discovers codebase & generates team configs
```

**4. Daily workflow**
```bash
/hive:standup   # Review yesterday, surface blockers
/hive:plan      # Design → horizontal scan → vertical slice → agent-ready stories
/hive:execute   # Orchestrator runs stories through dev workflow (research → implement → test → review → integrate)
/hive:review    # Structured code review (correctness, security, conventions)
/hive:ship      # Reconcile work, bump version, run release action, mark stories shipped
```

Each story produces a committed, reviewed state. The orchestrator handles coordination; you provide judgment at the planning and review gates.

### Testing

`/hive:test` runs the test swarm using Playwright (web) and Maestro (mobile) by default. An additional **`actual-manual` tier** is available for vision-cursor fidelity testing — it clicks real pixel-grounded coordinates and verifies each step's outcome, catching render-fidelity failures that the DOM cannot expose.

| Mode | How to enable | What it does |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `simulated` (default) | no config needed | Playwright/Maestro — fast, deterministic |
| `actual` | `HIVE_TEST_MODE=actual` or `test.mode: actual` in `hive.config.yaml` | Vision-cursor flow runner — pixel-grounded clicks + per-step outcome verification |

**`actual-manual` prerequisite:** a local MLX Qwen2.5-VL sidecar must be running before invoking this tier (provides the grounding model on-device).

**Scope note:** `actual-manual` is web-first (Playwright). Mobile/Maestro binding and CI MLX provisioning are explicit follow-ons. Vision is a targeted escalation — Playwright stays primary; use `actual-manual` when you suspect render-fidelity failures the DOM cannot expose.

## Commands

**Core workflow**
- `/hive:kickoff` — initialize Hive for a project
- `/hive:standup` — daily ceremony and blockers
- `/hive:triage` — capture and prioritize bugs/features
- `/hive:plan` — decompose work into agent-ready stories
- `/hive:execute` — run stories through implementation workflow
- `/hive:review` — structured code/PR review
- `/hive:test` — test swarm for coverage, execution, and bug routing
- `/hive:ship` — reconcile, bump version, run the release action, mark stories shipped
- `/hive:status` — active epics, story progress, and drift trend
- `/hive:ship` — cut a release: reconcile stories, author human-readable changelog prose (draft → operator review → write to `CHANGELOG.md`), verify version bump, run ship target. Changelog format rules live in [`hive/references/changelog-entry-format.md`](hive/references/changelog-entry-format.md).

**Design & UI**
- `/hive:brand-system` — colors, typography, spacing, visual guide
- `/hive:design` — wireframes and design handoff
- `/hive:design-system` — W3C design tokens from brand system
- `/hive:design-review` — critique designs or implementations
- `/hive:polish-audit` — motion/delight opportunities after UI audit
- `/hive:visual-qa` — compare implementation against design briefs
- `/hive:logo-exploration` — generate logo directions and contact sheets

**Marketing** _(consumer projects only — not invoked for Hive's own internal work)_
- `/hive:marketing-campaign` — changelog-driven launch campaign: marketing-strategist derives a campaign brief from what shipped, marketing-copywriter produces copy, ad-creative produces visual concepts and image-gen prompts
- **marketing-strategist** — positioning, audience segmentation, go-to-market strategy, and campaign brief authoring
- **marketing-copywriter** — ad copy, landing page copy, email sequences, social posts, taglines, and CTAs
- **ad-creative** — visual concept direction, creative briefs, and image-gen prompts for paid and organic channels

**Project intelligence**
- `/hive:context-snapshot` — JSON snapshot of epics, stories, triage, metrics
- `/hive:metrics-check` — post-merge metric verdicts
- `/hive:why` — query decision provenance from the knowledge graph
- `/hive:register-project` — register a project for cross-project KG bootstrap
- `/hive:find-skills` — mine recurring patterns for new skills
- `/hive:write-skill` — scaffold a new skill from a brief
- `/hive:meta-optimize` — run public meta-improvement experiments

**Optional Integrations**
Hive works out of the box after `/hive:kickoff`. Add these only when you want the corresponding execution substrate:
- `/hive:multica-init` — one-time Multica execution substrate setup
- `/hive:sandbox-setup` — one-time Sandcastle/Codex sandbox auth setup
- `/hive:sandcastle-gh-init` — GitHub Actions glue for Sandcastle execution

Then opt in through `hive.config.yaml` or `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE` when you want `/hive:execute` to use that path.

**Advanced helper**
- `/hive:grill` — adversarial design stress-test, usually invoked by `/hive:plan`

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent teams**: 25 specialized personas coordinate through structured workflows
- **Cross-model execution**: Route implementation to OpenAI Codex while Claude handles orchestration/review (reduces cost & bias)
- **Test swarm**: 5-agent pipeline that runs tests, files bugs, and routes fixes automatically
- **Layered memory (L0–L3)**: Persists decisions across sessions/projects via session insights, compiled wiki, knowledge graph, and optional ChromaDB semantic index
- **Extensible by design**: Add agents, skills, workflows, and teams without touching core code

## Inspirations

Hive stands on the shoulders of the agentic-engineering community. We borrow patterns and posture from camps that came before us:

- **[IndyDevDan](https://www.youtube.com/@indydevdan)** — agentic engineering as a _practice_; videos, principles, taste
- **[QRSPI](https://github.com/matanshavit/qrspi)** — 8-phase Claude Code workflow (Question · Research · Structure · Plan · Implement); builder workflows and real-world patterns
- **[BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)** — structured multi-agent methodology and role taxonomy
- **[archon](https://github.com/coleam00/archon)** — orchestration runtime and agent-execution patterns
- **[Matt Pocock](https://www.mattpocock.com)** — atomic-skill design: composable, single-purpose, well-named units of capability
- **[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai)** — the intellectual current of software 2.0/3.0

We don't compete with them; we synthesize, in a specific shape, on a specific surface (Claude Code), and put it in the open. Where their patterns show up in Hive, the credit travels with the claim.

## DAG-on-Multica Execution Substrate

Hive's four core flows (`/plan`, `/execute`, `/test`, `/review`) run on a deterministic DAG executor. When you enable Multica, each agent node in the graph is dispatched as a contained Multica task — the DAG still owns flow control, gate evaluation, routing, schema validation, and resume; Multica provides only the agent-execution layer behind the `AgentSpawn` protocol seam.

### How it works

```
/hive:execute
    │
    ▼
DAG Executor (deterministic)
  │  owns: flow / routing / gates / validation / resume
  │
  ├── agent node ──→ [AgentSpawn] ──→ Multica issue + agent run
  │                                        (work happens here)
  ├── reconcile node ──→ fetches agent's commit into working tree
  └── gate node ──→ reads committed files — never trusts agent self-report
```

Every artifact-producing flow ends in a **validation gate** that reads committed files on disk. The gate only sees what was actually committed; an agent that claims success but writes nothing fails the gate.

### Enabling per flow

Set the mode knob in `hive.config.yaml` (or override with an env var):

```yaml
# Enable Multica for /plan
planning:
  mode: multica          # values: multica | local (default)

# Enable Multica for /execute, /test, /review
execution:
  mode: multica          # values: multica | local (default)
```

**Env override** — `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE` overrides the `execution.mode` knob for a single run:

```bash
HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE=multica /hive:execute my-epic
```

Precedence (highest → lowest):

1. Explicit `binding` arg passed to the executor
2. `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE` env var
3. `planning.mode` / `execution.mode` config knob
4. Default: `local` (shells `claude --print` in-process)

### Operational prerequisites

Before enabling Multica mode:

1. **Multica daemon running** — `multica daemon start` (or the daemon must be running in background).
2. **Workspace config** — `~/.multica/config.json` must have `server_url`, `token`, and `workspace_id` set (or pass via `MULTICA_SERVER_URL`, `MULTICA_TOKEN`, `MULTICA_WORKSPACE_ID`).
3. **Repo bind** — run `/hive:multica-init` to bind the project's git repository URL to the workspace. Without this, each Multica task workdir has no repo and agents cannot commit output. Binding is idempotent; run it once per project.
4. **Codex agents for headless runs (R1)** — Multica Studio's keychain/launchd root means Claude agents 401 when running without a GUI session. Route nodes that must run headless to Codex agents via `agent_backends` in `hive.config.yaml`. See [Operations Guide — DAG-on-Multica](docs/operations-guide.md#dag-on-multica-substrate) for details.
