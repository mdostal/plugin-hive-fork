## [Unreleased]

## [2.16.0] - 2026-07-22

### Version

- **minor bump `2.15.1` → `2.16.0`.** Anchored by `mcp-rc-bridge-compat`. This release promotes the full `develop → main` diff merged since 2.15.1 went live (2026-07-20): `mcp-rc-bridge-compat` (#77), `agent-skill-adaptation` (#74), `multica-review-convergence` (#78), `multica-substrate-deepen` (#81), `cc-regression-hardening` (#80), and the Multica execute-reliability fixes (#71/#73/#75). All are documented here so the published changelog matches the full diff. Version sources (plugin.json, marketplace.json top-level + `plugins[0]`, README badge) in lockstep at `2.16.0`.

### Added

- **Agent-assigned skill adaptation (6 stories, #74).** Wires Hive personas to **actually invoke** their bound skills through a shared resolve→load→invoke seam instead of trusting inert step-file prose. Ships the seam, packages four skills as authoritative invoked skills, proves cross-language invocation, and closes discovery with a prioritized backlog.
- **Multica substrate-deepen (19 stories, #81).** Expands Multica integration from ~15% toward substrate-first coverage across the dispatch/execute surfaces.

### Fixed

- **MCP bridge compat: published-version negotiation + Claude Code min-version gate.** Both hand-rolled MCP servers now share a published-version allowlist, echo supported client versions, and fall back to `2025-11-25` for omitted or unsupported versions. The SessionStart gate (floor `2.1.217`) also fails loudly when the installed version is too old or cannot be verified. Full surface-by-surface verdicts live in `.pHive/epics/mcp-rc-bridge-compat/docs/compat-audit.md`.
- **DAG-multica review loop converges without hand-adjudication (5 stories, #78).** Closes the review-loop churn that drove multi-story Multica `/execute` runs to the fix-cycle cap — review scope and per-round commit/verdict correlation now reach a converged verdict without manual branch adjudication.
- **Multica execute reliability: fatal reconcile barriers + exact-commit harvest (#71/#73/#75).** Failed non-optional reconcile nodes now halt instead of degrading into downstream skips and hollow-green completion (#71); harvest no longer trusts reused daemon-local integration refs — it correlates HEAD and the local target against the executor snapshot, waits until the exact task commit is reachable from a stable origin integration ref, and preserves the exact per-task SHA when the shared branch advances again (#73/#75).
- **Claude Code compatibility boundary hardened (`cc-regression-hardening`, #80).** Centralizes the supported Claude Code floor at `2.1.217` with a policy-driven hook gate, corrects recursive-permission guidance, adds fail-loud pre-graph worktree isolation checks (pinned-ref + symlink-escape defenses), preserves explicit reviewer model identity across follow-up/rerun/resume dispatches, and adds hermetic Python regression suites plus a compatibility matrix. Covers triage items t-010, t-012, t-013, t-016, t-017, t-018, t-021.
- **Version drift reconciled.** `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json` (top-level + `plugins[0]`), and the README badge were three-way inconsistent (`2.15.1` / `2.16.0` split); all now read `2.16.0` in lockstep.

### Compat notes

- **BC2 (SDK sub-package split): n-a.** Repo-wide verdict — no surface imports the affected `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` sub-packages.
- **BC3 (SEP-2577 capability deprecations): unaffected.** All in-repo MCP surfaces advertise `capabilities: { tools: {} }` only; `sampling`/`roots`/`logging` are not used.

## [2.15.1] - 2026-07-20

### Version

- **patch bump `2.15.0` → `2.15.1`.** This release promotes **all development merged to `develop` since 2.15.0 went live (2026-07-05)** — 7 epics in total. The two planned `minor` epics were reconciled to `patch` for a single consolidated patch release. Version sources (plugin.json, marketplace.json, README badge) in lockstep.
- The 07-13 batch (`wfd-retro-hardening` #63, `metrics-observability` #64, `skill-footprint` #65, `cmux-modernization` #66) was planned and executed this ship cycle. Three more epics merged to `develop` earlier in the same post-2.15.0 window and ship now as part of the same promotion: `python-hardening` (#53), `sandcastle-stub-hygiene` (#61), `multica-learning-loop` (#45). All seven are documented below so the published changelog matches the full `develop → main` diff.

### Added

- **WFD-retro-hardening: process-visibility detectors + deterministic ship checks + plan-drift instrument (7 stories).** completion-record detector (SubagentStop/Stop), `/ship` no-squash merge-shape check, plan-derived `manual_verdict` aging + required-device-pass gate, narrowed check-agent-misuse Pattern-1, completion-marker contract wired into the operative team-prompt assembler, plan-drift instrument (depends_on_epic/planned_base_ref + merge-base reconciliation gate + metric), and lean-agent-prompt reference + override incident-field validation (moved to `hive/lib/insight_validation.py` on merge to avoid a filename collision with the learning-loop harvest module).
- **Metrics-observability: expose the pipeline + per-skill token sensor (4 stories).** `/metrics` read-only command over the collect+render pipeline (mo-1); per-skill token sensor attributing token spend at the `Stop` hook boundary with a `/metrics` rollup view (mo-2, with the collect_tokens double-count fixed on merge); events gitignore taxonomy + collector foreign-row guard + `agent_spawn` validator (mo-3); learning-loop cold/warm dimension with a classic-path-only caveat (mo-4).

- **Skill-footprint: safe conditional extractions + regression lint (4 stories).** Agent-skills best-practices grounding + corpus audit (sf-0); extracted the scope-conditional H/V + Structured-Outline plan phases to `skills/plan/references/` behind conditional reads (sf-1); CI `skill-size-lint` job with an 800-line cap + grandfather-ratchet allowlist (sf-2); read-only Phase-C compression-scope classification doc for a future epic (sf-3).
- **Cmux-modernization: hook-correlation spike -> NO-GO (spike only).** cm-1 proved event-driven codex completion is infeasible in Hive's `interactive_panes` dispatch mode (notification id is panel-scoped, not the dispatch-time `CMUX_SURFACE_ID`; cmux drops codex's native `turn_id` before the event bus). cm-2 not built; poll/`report_shell_state` retained. Recorded as `outcome: stop-after-spike`.

### Also shipped this release (merged to develop earlier in the same post-2.15.0 window)

These epics merged to `develop` after 2.15.0 but before the 07-13 batch above. They ship in the same `develop → main` promotion; recording them here keeps the released changelog matched to the full diff.

- **Python-hardening: tighten the canonical `hive/lib` runtime (9 stories, PR #53).** `config.py` fallback-path characterization tests (ph-1) + log-first `except` hardening with narrowed JSON probes (ph-2); documented + conformance-tested the 3-file config precedence (ph-3); KG-emit consolidation audit + parity fixture + plan, no code swap (ph-4); deduped the paths-block YAML scanner shared by `config.py` and `harness/snapshot.py` (ph-5); read-and-confirm analysis of the 9-file hand-rolled-YAML consolidation candidates (ph-6); `dag_executor` boundary analysis + written extraction plan, no code moves (ph-7); confirmed + deleted orphan Node files (ph-8); ported a 3-file Node tranche — `git_flow`, cc-workflows model-tier, cc-workflows preconditions — to Python (ph-9). Advances the Python-first charter without touching the named bridge surfaces.
- **Sandcastle-stub-hygiene: repo hygiene (2 stories, PR #61).** Root-caused and fixed a `TMPDIR`→repo-root leak at the confirmed layer with a `.gitignore` backstop (hy-1); direct-execution repo tidy — worktree prune + proposals archive (hy-2). Sandcastle extraction itself remains deferred to an external-repo spinout.
- **Multica agent learning loop: dispatched agents build on prior experience (3 stories, PR #45).** Read side — stamp the persona on dispatch and inject Prior Experience into the Multica story brief (s1); write side — curated harvest of self-capture into committed team-memories + KG at episode close (s2); verified the loop end-to-end on the studio daemon and settled the KG learning predicate (s3).

## [2.15.0] - 2026-07-05

**Event-driven execution, effort-adaptive runs, and a metric-capture harness — plus MCP-stateless readiness and a config-reference refresh.**

### Added

- **Event-driven execution loop** (epic `e5-execution-loop`, PR #29). Replaces
  timer-polling of background-agent completion with a `SubagentStop` hook that writes
  a `complete.json` marker; reconcile and the execution loop now consume the marker
  instead of polling for terminal state, and Hive skips creating a duplicate PR when a
  dispatched background agent already opened its own draft PR. Bash `run_in_background`
  work has no completion hook in this runtime and is deliberately left on the poll path.
- **Metric capture harness** (epic `metric-capture-harness`, PR #33). Instruments Hive
  runs to reconstruct the build journey as visual aids — durable human-gate-time capture
  from the DAG's `user_gate` handler, before/after run-boundary snapshots with a diff
  helper, a collector that rolls metrics/episodes/snapshots into a single report, and a
  self-contained HTML dashboard renderer with mermaid/SVG exports — first exercised
  end-to-end on `/design-system`.
- **`$CLAUDE_EFFORT`-aware execution + 1M-context personas** (epic
  `context-effort-adaptation`, PR #31). A new session-start gate resolves the
  `$CLAUDE_EFFORT` tier (low/medium/high/xhigh) so `low` effort skips the test-swarm and
  `xhigh` escalates to forced security/performance audits; the orchestrator and
  researcher personas also gained prompt-level guidance to exploit the 1M-context window
  (read more before summarizing) within existing scope/time tiers.

### Changed

- **MCP stateless-behavior audit** (epic `mcp-stateless-behavior`, PR #28). Audited
  Hive's MCP-touching surfaces ahead of the 2026-07-28 stateless-MCP cutover; corrected
  session-affinity wording in `session-resilience.md` and added a stateless
  session-taxonomy note, and audited the `multica-story-dispatch` Node bridge for
  compliance with the no-session-handshake spec.
- **Config reference refresh** (epic `config-reference-refresh`, PR #30). Doc-only
  refresh of `hive/references/configuration.md` and related reference docs — QA'd the
  `fallbackModel` section against current Claude Code behavior, added a `/config`
  shortcut reference, an `anthropicAws` stub, and a `denyTools` cross-reference, and
  documented `claude mcp login --no-browser` for headless MCP setup, keeping the file
  scoped to Hive-owned `hive.config.yaml` surfaces.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-07-03

**DAG executor re-platform — contract-derived scheduling + static loop unroll.**
Headline is the two-epic bundle promoted via PR #20 (`version_bump: minor` —
drove this release); the release train also promotes several `version_bump: none`
epics that accumulated on `develop` since 2.13.4 (see "Also in this release").

### Added

- **RLM/Open-Prose-informed DAG evolution** (epic `rlm-openprose-dag`, PR #20,
  `version_bump: minor`). Layers four capabilities on Hive's deterministic DAG
  spine while keeping it the audit/observability backbone:
  - **Contract-derived DAG + reconcile-on-drift memoization** (`b`) — the graph
    is derived from declared node contracts; unchanged upstream contracts skip
    re-execution (drift-memoized scheduling).
  - **Reference-based cross-node data passing** (`c`) — nodes pass data by
    reference across the graph instead of inline copy.
  - **Configurable hive-dag executor binding** (`p`) — all flows resolve their
    spawn binding via `resolve_spawn_binding` (local / multica / sandcastle /
    cc-workflows).
  - **Bounded converge-loop primitive** (`t-005`/`t-006`) — the LOOP NodeType and
    a converge-loop `review.workflow.yaml` (superseded at execution time by the
    static unroll below, retained as an authoring keyword).
  - **RLM-style recursive node** (`a`) — experimental, feature-flagged spike.
- **Static loop unroll + configurable loop templates** (epic
  `loop-unroll-templates`, PR #20, `version_bump: none`). Bounded LOOP nodes are
  unrolled at **load time** into conditional DAG round-copies — the runtime LOOP
  engine is retired; the executor walks a pure acyclic graph.
  - **Load-time unroll expander** (`s2`) — `node_type: loop` → `<node>__r<k>`
    round-copies + terminal gate; authoring keyword preserved, zero author-facing
    change.
  - **Boolean convergence-signal contract** (`s3`) — unrolled loops short-circuit
    on a declared boolean (`review_passed`/`tests_green`/`behavior_satisfied`/
    `coverage_satisfied`) via a converged-latch `skip_when` OR-chain.
  - **Per-feature `loops:` config** (`s1`) — `loops.<feature>.{enabled,max_rounds}`
    with `env > root > baseline` precedence and `HIVE_LOOPS_<FEATURE>_*` overrides.
  - **First-class loop templates** — TDD red-green (`s5`), BDD converge (`s6`),
    test-swarm rounds (`s7`), and a skill-level grill loop (`s8`). `review_converge`
    / `tdd_red_green` / `bdd_converge` default **on**; `test_swarm` / `grill`
    default **off** (opt-in — "turn grill on, set N rounds").
  - **Load-time guards** — unbounded, nested, dep-less, and empty-body featured
    loops, plus compound-gate/multi-exit early-convergence hazards, are rejected
    at load (`GraphLoadError`) instead of surfacing as runtime surprises.

### Changed

- **Retire runtime LOOP machinery** (`s4`) — `NodeType.LOOP` runtime dispatch,
  the in-place `sub_graph` iterator, and the loop handler are removed from the
  executor. `node_type: loop` remains a parse-time authoring keyword only.
- **Reconcile emits declared `reconcile_status`** — the real-sha merge path now
  returns `reconcile_status: "merged"` (previously only the no-op path emitted it),
  matching the 8 workflow bindings that consume it.
- **Classic workflow empty-domain skip cascade** — `fix-cycle-review` gained the
  `when: "$test.output.test_artifacts != null"` twin so review rounds skip
  cleanly when there is no implementation to review.

### Fixed

- **27 pre-existing PR #20 test-suite failures** resolved (metric-signal routing,
  meta-team-cycle drift, scan-roots frozen-clock, parity bar, reconcile status,
  decomposition joins) — full suite green (**1522 passed / 0 failed / 3 skipped**).
- **Version sources back in lockstep** — `marketplace.json` (2.13.3) and
  `plugin.json` (2.13.4) reconciled to **2.14.0**.

### Also in this release

Co-shipped epics that landed on `develop` since 2.13.4 (all `version_bump: none`
— reference/roster/skill surfaces, no core-engine semver impact):

- **External model integration — roster re-pin** (PR #24). Re-pins the agent
  roster to Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 across the dispatchable personas and wires the
  `/plan` grill (Phase A2) model selection to match.
- **Actual-manual test tier** (PR #17). Adds a manual-test execution mode
  (`test-mode-actual`) and registers it in test dispatch — the SimMan spin-out
  bridge seam for vision-cursor manual runs.
- **Auto-spawn migration follow-on** (PR #16). Completes the TeamCreate/TeamDelete
  retirement begun in 2.13.4's `meta-epic-1`: migrates remaining call sites to the
  `Agent(name:)` auto-spawn mechanism (agent-teams guide, orchestrator/team-lead,
  `hive.config.yaml`).
- **LSP suggestion + kickoff discovery** (PR #14). Suggests an LSP on language
  detection and adds kickoff discovery questions.
- **Absorb 5 Claude Code capability shifts** (epic `meta-epic-2`, PR #11):
  nested-subagent depth, fallback-model routing, cost-USD in `/standup`,
  domain-native permissions, and marketplace tags folded into Hive's reference
  surfaces.

Not release-noted (internal only): idea-digest housekeeping (PRs #4/#8) touching
`.pHive/meta-team` files.

## [2.13.4] - 2026-06-26

**Capability absorption + visual planning.** Two-epic bundle promoted to `main` via PR #9.

### Added

- **Visual Planning Enrichment** (epic `visual-plan-enrichment`, PLU-446..454, PR #5).
  Python cutover of the Mermaid CDN to build-time inline SVG, titled + annotated
  diagrams, a 0-KB visual shine layer, and configurable retention via sidecar
  shine/serve. (`version_bump: patch` — drove this release.)

### Changed

- **Absorb validated Claude Code capability shifts into Hive** (epic `meta-epic-1`,
  PR #7→develop). Folds five upstream Claude Code shifts into Hive's reference
  surfaces (`version_bump: none`):
  - **TeamCreate/TeamDelete removal migration** — migrated ~30 call sites across
    hooks, skills, references, and tests from the removed `TeamCreate`/`TeamDelete`
    tools to the `Agent(name:)` teammate mechanism, with flag-aware sequential
    fallback (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`). Updated the
    `check-agent-misuse.sh` hook and plan-wire tests; recorded a call-site inventory.
  - **Ephemeral working-memory tier** — `.pHive/task-notes/{story-id}/`, written
    during execution and discarded at story close (non-promotion invariant);
    wired into classic/tdd/meta-team implement steps.
  - **Parameter-level permission matching** — `Tool(param:value)` granular
    permission patterns + role-to-deny-list guidance.
  - **PostToolUse `updatedToolOutput` conventions** — new `hooks-conventions.md`
    reference + Sandcastle-hooks disambiguation note.
  - **Security + performance review dimensions** — opt-in `--security` /
    `--performance` / `--all-dimensions` flags for `/review`, default-off,
    regression-free baseline.

## [2.13.3] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **`/plan` DAG executor routing** (epic `plan-dag-cutover`, PR #327). Routes `/plan`
  through the deterministic DAG executor when configured, mirroring the `/execute`
  cutover. Activation is graduation-registry-gated (`planning.mode: hive-dag` or
  `HIVE_PLANNING_MODE=hive-dag`), so the default orchestrator-narrated path has zero
  regression. Resolved by new `plan-dispatch` atomic skill (`is_workflow_graduated('plan')`
  registry-only check, isolated from execute-flow keys).

- **Conditional `user_gate` node type** (`s3`). New DAG node type that evaluates an
  `auto_pass_when` predicate at runtime — auto-passes when confident, halts the executor
  for human review when not. Pause/resume contract preserves graph state across the gate.
  Reject is terminal (converge-loop deferred).

- **Gate signals** (`s4`). H/V nodes emit `confidence`; structured-outline nodes
  emit `open_questions_count`. These feed the respective `user_gate` predicate
  evaluations (Design nodes do not emit scored signals).

- **Plan cutover test suite + graduation** (`s5`). Cutover acceptance tests,
  `UserGateHandler` unit tests (7 ACs), spine-parity test for `plan.workflow.yaml`
  with `user_gate` nodes, execute dispatch-parity guard. `plan` registered as Order 10
  in `.pHive/runtime/executor-graduated-workflows.yaml`. `user_gate` node type
  documented in `hive/references/workflow-schema.md`.

## [2.13.2] - 2026-06-24

**Wiring the lights-on loop's runtime — first autonomous stories.** Partial delivery of the `hermes-production-readiness` epic: the loop-closer's inbound transport and the human "go" entrypoint, plus the Studio runtime templates. Executed through the DAG-on-Multica path (which also surfaced — and got fixed — a per-story `story_spec` scoping gap in the launcher).

### Added

- **Inbound Slack → resolveGate, repo slice** (`hpr-1`). `slack-notify-await.mjs` now emits Slack **Block Kit** blocks with gate-action buttons (`approve` / `revise` / `reject`, encoding the gate action as compact keys `{a: action, e: epic_handle, s: story_id}` in the button value) alongside the plain-text fallback, plus `parseGateAction()` and `resolveGateInvoker()` — the thin, tested entrypoint a Studio HTTP receiver calls (only **after verifying the Slack request signature**) to drive `resolveGate`. The receiver itself (hermes-agent HTTP endpoint + HMAC signature verification over the raw request body, before any cycle-state read/write) remains the Studio-side follow-up.
- **Epic-approval bootstrap** (`hpr-4`). `epic-bootstrap.mjs` — the gated human "go" that latches a chosen epic's initial `gate_state: pre_approved` + `epic_of_record` through the validated write boundary, with an optional Slack notice. Human-invoked only; structurally off the reconcile-tick surface so the orchestrator can never self-approve.
- **Studio runtime plumbing templates** (`hpr-5`). A launchd daemon-autostart plist, a health-probe script, the `~/.hermes/config.yaml` MCP-wiring template, and an env-contract doc, plus a Studio Runtime Setup section in the operations guide. The live Studio runtime was verified durable (`RunAtLoad` + `KeepAlive`, all services loaded).
- **Slack app + secrets** (`hpr-3`). A reproducible Slack-app runbook (`slack-app-runbook.md`) covering app creation, the `chat:write` scope, the four `HERMES_SLACK_*` values, root-only `secrets.env` storage, and rotation. The app was provisioned and **outbound posting verified live** (webhook 200/ok); secrets stored on Studio at `chmod 600`. The inbound receiver + live-process activation (gateway sources `secrets.env`, requires a Hermes restart) are documented as follow-ups.

### Security

- **Path-traversal hardening.** Epic handles compose filesystem paths (`<dir>/<handle>.yaml`); both composers — `validateEpicHandle` (`epic-bootstrap.mjs`) and `resolveGateInvoker` (`slack-notify-await.mjs`) — now reject any handle that is not a `[a-z0-9-]` slug, so a hostile inbound payload cannot escape the cycle-state dir.
- **Gate-transition atomicity.** `resolveGate`'s precondition check and transition now run inside one locked read-modify-write (`mutateHermesReconcilerState`), closing a check-then-write race where a concurrent reconcile-tick could let a stale Slack click clobber a terminal transition.
- **Webhook target constraint.** Outbound Slack posts now require `https` to a Slack host (loopback `http` permitted only for tests), preventing a misconfigured/injected webhook URL from exfiltrating verdict context.

### Notes

- Deferred to a follow-up: the hpr-1 **Studio-side receiver** (hermes-agent HTTP endpoint + signature verification), the **live-process activation** of hpr-3's secrets (gateway restart), and an out-of-scope **executor-graph cascade-skip** change the hpr-1 run produced (isolated for its own review, not shipped here).

## [2.13.1] - 2026-06-23

**Codifying the orchestrator so a persistent Hermes cron can run the loop.** This release turns the Hive orchestrator from a thing a human drives into a contract a Hermes agent drives — five Hermes-side skill runbooks plus the gate, MCP, and Slack plumbing they stand on. The north star is a lights-on software factory where the human is in the loop only at planning and review; the orchestrator and agents own everything between.

### Added

- **Hermes orchestrator skills** (epic `hermes-orchestrator-skills`, PR #321). Five Hermes-side runbooks — `monitor-epic`, `reconcile-tick`, `kickoff-plan`, `kickoff-exec`, `watch-cron` — that codify the cycle-reconciler's 7-position phase machine (pending → dispatched_impl → impl_terminal → dispatched_review → review_terminal → done) as the contract a Hermes cron uses to drive the forked Multica instance, gating humans only at planning and at the review verdict.
- **Multica MCP surface** (`h-02`). A JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio MCP server (`mcp-tools.mjs`) wrapping the dispatch `cli.mjs` subcommands as seven tools — `multica_dispatch_story`, `multica_poll_task`, `multica_epic_status`, `multica_write_state`, `multica_post_comment`, `multica_episode`, `multica_cancel` — so Hermes invokes the bridge as native tools instead of shelling out.
- **gate_state latch + epic_of_record** (`h-03`). The cross-tick autonomy contract: a `gate_state` enum (`pre_approved` / `review_awaiting_human` / `finalized` / `rejected`) latches the human review gate across reconciler ticks, and `epic_of_record` pins the reconciler's target epic. Writes are validated at a single state-write boundary with an advisory lock around the read-modify-write.
- **Slack notify-and-await human gate** (`h-06`). The outbound half of the review gate: surfaces a verdict or error to Slack and resolves the gate via `resolveGate` (approve → story done, revise → re-dispatch, reject, continue), with the passed-verdict auto-advance model (model "b" — ff-merge-verified passes advance automatically; only non-pass/unverified/error surface to the human).
- **Studio port + operations guide** (`h-01`, `h-10`). The five runbooks ported to the Hermes-agent native `SKILL.md` format on Studio, the Multica MCP server wired into the Hermes runtime config, and the end-to-end lights-on loop documented in the operations guide.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-06-23

**Hardening the substrate by running it on itself.** The DAG-on-Multica execution path got tougher the only honest way — by dogfooding a real epic through it and fixing what broke. This release lands the execute-flow follow-ons (gate-review across every methodology, review-sees-implement-tree, output-channel coverage), the executor-reliability fixes that dogfooding surfaced, a Simplicity/KISS standard for the dev personas, and step-file plugin-root resolution. Reviewed cross-LLM (Codex + CodeRabbit), including a comprehensive pass that caught a silent-stale-review hole before release.

### Added

- **Execute-flow follow-ons** (epic `execute-flow-followons-converge-loop`, PR #318). The gate-review node (a review verdict of `needs_revision` blocks integrate) is mirrored into the tdd and bdd methodology workflows, not just classic; each implement node now reconciles its output into the working tree so review reads the real implemented code *before* integrate (`review-sees-implement-tree`); and the Multica `#13` output channel is seeded into consumer repos' `.gitignore` at repo-bind.
- **Node-output harvest + the `#13` output channel** (PR #316). The general channel by which a Multica agent emits a node's declared semantic outputs (`.pHive/dag-outputs/outputs.yaml`, harvested by the executor), plus committed-artifact and git-state harvest.
- **Simplicity (KISS) quality standard** for the developer personas and the idiomatic-reviewer (PR #317) — choose the simplest implementation that satisfies the acceptance criteria; a reviewer should not be able to delete code and keep all criteria passing.
- **Step-file plugin-root resolution** (PR #314).

### Fixed

- **Under-run reliability on Multica** (PR #318). A flaky agent turn that ended without writing its declared `outputs.yaml` caused intermittent, difficulty-independent node failures. The under-run guard now re-harvests every work_dir seen before re-dispatching (recovering a commit that landed after the poll reported terminal), enforces the *full* declared-output set (a partial `outputs.yaml` no longer flows downstream), and every Multica dispatch carries a hard output-contract naming the required keys.
- **Per-node reconcile fails loud** (PR #318). A reconcile that cannot materialise the implement commit (e.g. a non-fast-forward) now halts the run instead of silently letting review read a stale tree.
- **Meta structural-audit cycle** (PR #315).

## [2.12.1] - 2026-06-21

**The substrate that runs Hive's own flows now runs on Multica — and the team that announces a release now has a home.** This release lands the DAG-on-Multica execution substrate (Hive's deterministic flow engine running its agent work through Multica) and a consumer-gated marketing team, both reviewed cross-LLM (Codex) before merge.

### Added

- **DAG-on-Multica execution substrate** (epic `dag-flows-multica`, PR #310). Hive's DAG executor now runs plan / execute (classic·tdd·bdd) / test / review flows on a shared substrate where the DAG owns flow, gates, routing, schema-validation, and resume, while Multica provides agent execution behind the `AgentSpawn` Protocol. Includes the `MulticaAgentSpawn` binding (idempotent on run_id+step_id, surfaces terminal failures), an explicit reconcile node (ff-merges agent commits before the gate), real schema-validation gates (`validate_output`), bounded per-node retry (`Node.retry`, executed by the walker), a unified per-flow backend resolver (`HIVE_{FLOW}_MODE`), episode markers, and cross-flow resume.
- **Consumer-gated marketing team** (epic `marketing-team`, PR #307). New `marketing-strategist`, `marketing-copywriter`, and `ad-creative` personas plus a `/marketing-campaign` skill that turns a changelog into a launch campaign under `.pHive/campaigns/<topic>/`. Wired as a `/ship` step-9 hook that is double-gated (consumer-app project + explicit `--campaign`/`ship.campaign` opt-in) and a silent no-op for Hive's own internal work.

### Fixed

- Resolved two pre-existing `dag_executor` test failures (a `daily-ceremony` dangling dependency ref and a `test-swarm` skip-cascade when an opt-in node is absent).

## [2.12.0] - 2026-06-20

**Plan and ship like a human — visually rich planning docs, human-readable release notes by default, requirement-driven planning teams, a self-cleaning runtime, and the first cut of a persistent SDLC orchestrator.**

### Added

- **Design-aware, visually rich planning** (PR #297): planning documents now render as HTML sidecars with Mermaid figures in place of ASCII art, a canonical PRD skill emits HTML, and a visual `/plan` run closes with a generated concept image of the change — so plans read like design docs, not text dumps. Visual planning is on by default; opt out per-run with `/plan --no-visual` or persistently via `planning.visual: false`.
- **Human-readable release notes by default** (PR #289): `/ship` now drafts each changelog bullet from story outcomes — degrading to story descriptions when a story has no outcome field — and gates on a single canonical format spec before release, so operators review prose instead of authoring notes from scratch. This 2.12.0 entry is the first written to that spec.
- **Requirement-driven planning teams** (PR #299): `/plan` classifies a requirement into work-type tags and composes its planning team from a fixed spine plus the specialists the work actually needs, instead of a one-size-fits-all roster.
- **Self-cleaning runtime artifacts** (PR #300): a new artifact-lifecycle sweep moves inactive untracked runtime files to OS temp under per-class retention, hard-protects memories and the knowledge graph from eviction, and keeps a report-only inventory of tracked classes — clean working trees without risking durable state. Ships with a weekly scheduler wrapper and a full test suite.
- **Hermes SDLC reconciler — persistent-orchestrator core loop (MVP)** (PR #305): a thin `multica-story-dispatch` CLI (`cli.mjs`) gives an external Hermes cron job everything it needs to drive a Hive epic one tick at a time — dispatch the next story, poll a live task to terminal, write an episode marker, roll up `epic-status`, and post a `comment` — backed by a `hermes_reconciler` cross-tick state block in cycle-state (`state.mjs`) and a tick state-machine runbook. Dispatch now returns the Multica `task_id` and a `write-state` subcommand persists progress between ticks, so the loop advances implementation → review → done on its own instead of firing once and forgetting. Dogfooded end-to-end through Multica execution.
- **Cleaner installs and self-pruning ship** (PR #306): an install-payload audit documents exactly what reaches a marketplace install and flags runtime/dev cruft for exclusion, and `/hive:ship` now prunes a shipped epic's worktree after marking its stories shipped — so a release leaves no stray working trees behind.

### Fixed

- **Squad-evaluation reads survive pagination and shape drift** (PR #298): the advisory squad-evaluation signal now pages through the issue timeline to find the newest leader verdict and shares one parser and outcome-enum guard with the adapter, so a verdict on a later page is no longer silently missed. Read-only; it never gates a merge.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-06-11

**State-dir relocation, KG signal activation, and full substrate coverage — configurable state directory across all three runtimes, a knowledge graph that finally emits from production, and dispatch routers for every workflow mode.**

- **State-dir resolver** (PRs #276, #280): projects can now relocate Hive state out of `.pHive` via `HIVE_STATE_DIR` env or `paths.state_dir` in `hive.config.yaml`. Python-canonical resolver (`hive/lib/config.py`) with an 18-row, 3-runtime (Python/Node/shell) conformance fixture; adoption across story/session state, metrics readers + writers, context snapshot, triage, task-tracking + release handoff, scenarios/audits/reverse-sync, DAG executor run-state, and the shell semantic guard; suspend-aware weekly run-state archival sweep with positive-threshold validation; executable skill/workflow prose converted to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}` paths.
- **KG repair activation** (PRs #277, #278): the kg-signal pipeline now receives real triples — `phase_started`/`phase_complete` emitted from the DAG walker (including the resume replay path), `superseded` wired at its documented callsites, new `validated`/`tested`/`implemented` role predicates emitted by reviewer/tester/developer at shutdown, `/hive:kg-stats` density + predicate-breakdown skill, ChromaDB `RuntimeError` containment in `/hive:why`, `PRAGMA foreign_keys` on every kg.sqlite connection, and a density-verification job that drafts the kg_signal weight-bump PR.
- **Squad-leader status flip** (PR #274): squad leaders now reliably signal task completion — squad-leader terminal contract reference with TERMINAL-ACK marker, applied to planning-team squad instructions, plus a stale-parent sweep script with classification tests.
- **Substrate coverage & test cleanup** (PRs #254, #255): every workflow mode now has complete dispatch coverage across both runtimes — 5-tier `mode-resolver` helper, canonical 6×3 dispatch-parity matrix, design / design-review / review dispatch routers with multica + cc-workflows mode atoms, wireframe handoff payload (PNG + .f0 + constraint doc), simulated-manual folded into the test swarm as step-04b, `markNeedsRework` ABI method (contract-first TDD), multi-surface no-codex lint, cc-workflows preconditions + per-persona model-tier resolver.
- **Writer doc-skills** (PR #262): every writer doc-type is now a completeness-gated skill rather than a passive template.
- **Planning routing** (PR #273): planning now routes through Sonnet, aligning the model tier with available planning capacity.
- **Meta pipeline revival** (PRs #264–#272): the nightly meta-improvement cycle runs with richer signal and broader coverage — kg-signal wired into the meta-meta nightly routing gate, five new step-02 audit finders (CodeRabbit recurring comments, stale PRs, triage-queue aging, feedback memories, CI failure tail), loosened step-02b filter, and story-status-reconcile concurrency + dedup fixes.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-08

**Release lifecycle + Multica insight capture — `/ship`, status discipline, version-bump flow, release posts, and orchestrator-distilled Multica memory.**

The first epics planned *and* executed end-to-end through the Multica substrate.

- **Release lifecycle** (PR #247): canonical status-lifecycle contract (`hive/references/status-lifecycle.md`) with an `in_review → in_progress` rework edge; explicit success-gated status transitions wired into `/execute`, `/review`, `/test`; kickoff captures a per-project `ship_target` (App Store / Vercel / GitHub release / npm / custom); version-bump *intent* recorded at `/plan` and performed late in `/execute`; a release-post + video-script + post-ideas generator (`hive/lib/release_post.mjs`); and the new **`/ship`** capstone — pre-flight status reconciliation (the "finished but never marked" fix), version-bump verify, configured ship action behind a dry-run gate, then release-comms generation. Documented in README Quick Start + operations-guide.
- **Multica insight capture** (PR #250, from triage t-001): closes the gap where Multica execution mode ran none of Hive's pre-shutdown insight/memory capture. Agents now self-record insights via story-brief injection (`.hive/insights/<id>.md`); the orchestrator distills inline (full capability) into `team-memories/`, promoting durable cross-epic learnings to Hive memory; wired into `execute-mode-multica` + `pre-shutdown-protocol.md`.
- **Meta-team bookkeeping** (PR #246): squashed 7 stranded nightly cycles; reverted the `sonnet → opus` frontmatter flip (frontmatter stays base-tier; opus applies via `model_overrides`); purged stale `claude-opus-4-7` references.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-05-31

**Multica substrate deepens — execute / plan / test all route through Multica; meta-improvement reset; autonomous standup loop; Hermes integration MVP.**

Wraps the multi-epic push that started with v2.7.0's multica execute mode. This release
makes Multica the first-class dispatch substrate for the full `/execute` + `/plan` + `/test`
trio (PRs #223, #230, #234), pairs it with the meta-improvement-reset signal-quality work
(PR #224), adds the autonomous nightly standup loop (PR #211), and ships the Hermes
external-coordinator integration MVP (PR #218). Story-loop closure (PR #219) tightens the
post-merge feedback path. Multica-integration-fixes (PR #220) was credited in 2.8.0 Notes.

### Added

#### Multica substrate — execute mode wiring (PR #223, `feat/wire-execute-multica-codex`)

- **`/execute` Step 5/6e multica routing (`feat(execute): add multica routing case to step 5/6e`).** `/execute` now branches into the multica dispatch path when `execution.mode: multica` (or `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE=multica`) is set, mirroring the existing Sandcastle and GH-Actions paths.
- **Serial dispatch + episode-sync rewire of `execute-mode-multica` skill.** Skill now dispatches stories serially against the integration branch, with per-story episode markers written via `episode-sync.mjs`.
- **`/codex:rescue` brief injection when `backend=codex`.** `multica-story-dispatch` automatically prepends the rescue instruction when the per-persona provider routes to Codex, so the dispatched agent has the recovery contract in hand from turn 0.
- **`scope_drift_score` emission at story close.** `execute-mode-multica` now writes `scope_drift_score` to the episode marker at story close, feeding the meta-cycle drift telemetry.

#### Multica substrate — N-persona bootstrap + 22 dispatchable agents (PR #230, `feat/multica-substrate-deepen`)

- **`reconcileAgents` batched bootstrap.** `multica-bootstrap/index.mjs` batches the N-persona reconcile so 22 personas register in a single Multica call instead of N sequential calls.
- **22-persona `agents.yaml` with codex routing.** Expands the dispatchable roster to all major Hive personas (developer, reviewer, tester, architect, technical-writer, ui-designer, qa, et al.), with per-persona `provider:` so codex-routed personas pick up the right backend.
- **`reconcileSquads`, `reconcileAutopilots`, `reconcileSkills` bootstrap helpers (w2-3, w3-3, w4-3).** Squads, autopilots, and skills now reconcile declaratively against Multica with content-hash short-circuits.
- **`integrationBranch` dispatch option (single-shared-branch flow).** `multica-story-dispatch` accepts `integrationBranch:` so dispatched stories commit to a shared epic branch by default, matching Hive's "one branch per epic, one commit per story" convention.
- **`codexInstruction` conditional on per-persona provider (w1-4).** Codex instruction is only injected for personas whose provider routes to Codex; Claude-backed personas get the unmodified brief.
- **`.pHive/multica/squads.yaml` (w2-2).** Three default squads shipped alongside the agents roster.
- **Autopilot deprecation migration guide (w3-4).** `hive/references/` doc covers the autopilot → squad transition for substrate consumers.
- **`multica-skills-export-schema.md` (w4-1).** Documents the export contract for skills reconciliation.
- **Pilot round-trip validation finding (w4-5).** `.pHive/upstream-watch/` capture of the validated end-to-end dispatch round-trip.

#### Multica substrate — `/plan` + `/test --simulated-manual` routing (PR #234, `feat/multica-plan-test-cycles`)

- **Plan + test routing through Multica (planning artifacts shipped; implementation pinned as PLU-154..164 for next cycle).** Epic + 11 stories landed across docs/, stories/, research/ describing the `/plan` Phase 0 + `/test --simulated-manual` Multica routing contract. The single shipped code fix is `mpt-2`: `feat(multica-plan-test-cycles): reconcile scenario schema loader shape`.

#### Meta-improvement reset (PR #224, `feat/meta-improvement-reset`)

- **External research: Claude Code release-notes + Anthropic blog subproviders (mir-3/mir-2, 3.1).** `step-02b-external-research.md` now includes two explicit subproviders: `signal_subtype: claude_code_release` (GitHub Releases API / RSS) and `signal_subtype: anthropic_blog` (Anthropic news feed, filtered to model releases + capability announcements). Both tag `discovery_source: external_research`. Failure handling is empty-list-per-source, not error.
- **`meta_optimize.signal_weights` config knob (mir-8, 3.2).** New optional block in `hive.config.yaml` lets maintainers set per-source ranking multipliers (`metrics`, `external_research`, `kg_signal`, `dreaming_replay`, `backlog`). Shipped default weights reflect post-reset priorities (`external_research: 0.9`, `kg_signal: 0.4`, `backlog: 0.2`). Omitting the block preserves prior implicit-equal-weight behavior.
- **`/meta-shotgun` maintainer skill (mir-6/mir-7, 3.4).** New `maintainer-skills/meta-shotgun/SKILL.md` + `hive/workflows/meta-shotgun.workflow.yaml`. Batch-processes all `tier: little-fix` + `status: pending` candidates from the queue into a single PR (`meta-shotgun YYYY-MM`) targeting `develop`. Dry-run mode via `dry_run=true`. Zero-candidate exit is clean and silent. LOCAL-ONLY — not registered in `plugin.json`.
- **`tier:` field on `queue-meta-meta-optimize.yaml` candidates (mir-4/mir-5, 3.5).** New optional enum field (`little-fix | structural | strategic`; default `structural`). The nightly cycle now excludes `tier: little-fix` candidates (routed to `/meta-shotgun`). `tier: strategic` candidates require a planning epic before automated processing.
- **`hive/references/meta-shotgun-runbook.md`** — full runbook for the monthly shotgun cycle (prerequisites, failure recovery, queue hygiene, relationship to nightly cycle).

#### Autonomous standup loop (PR #211, `feat/autonomous-cycle-loop`)

- **`/standup --interactive` flag + Phase 1.5 hook (a-1).** Adds the interactive turn before the automated phases so an external scheduler can hand off seamlessly.
- **`/standup` wiring for `labelExistingIssue` + `migrate-local` (a-3).** Standup now labels existing tracker issues + migrates local-only state forward without manual intervention.
- **Scenario loader + `simulated-manual` step file (c-1).** Shared loader for scenario fixtures consumed by `/test` and the autonomous loop.
- **`/test --simulated-manual` wiring + `/plan simulated-manual` concern (c-2).** Both skills accept the `--simulated-manual` mode that the autonomous loop exercises end-to-end.
- **Handoff dispatch helper + `/execute` post-integrate step (d-1, d-2).** Handoff timeout hardening + no-PR fallback + KG triple emission close the loop between integrate and the next standup cycle.
- **Story status deriver + backfill script + post-merge CI hook (e-1).** `deriveStoryStatus` + `hive/scripts/backfill-story-status.mjs` keep YAML `status:` in lockstep with git+disk reality; post-merge CI now reconciles.

#### Hermes integration MVP (PR #218, `feat/hermes-integration-mvp`)

- **Episode-marker schema audit + `issue_id`/`issue_identifier` (s0-1).** Foundation for the Multica-issue closer feedback path.
- **`multica-issue-closer` module + unit tests (s1-1).** Closes Multica issues on `/execute` integrate; idempotent, schema-validated.
- **Multica close hook in `/execute` integrate step (s1-2).** Wires the closer to fire at integrate completion.
- **Reverse-sync: Multica cancelled → story YAML `status: deferred` (s2-1).** New `.github/workflows/multica-reverse-sync.yml` + `hive/scripts/multica-reverse-sync.mjs` script. Manual-trigger only (no schedule); secret-gated on `MULTICA_SERVER_URL`. Patches story YAML when matching Multica issues are cancelled, opens a chore PR with the diff.
- **`multica-issue-closer` runbook + docs link from closer + SKILL.md (s3-1).**

#### Story-loop closure (PR #219, `feat/story-loop-closure`)

- Tightens the post-merge feedback path so story status reconciliation, episode markers, and Multica issue close all fire in the correct order at integrate completion.

### Changed

- **Step-03c metric gate flipped to `blocking` by default (mir-9, 3.3).** Previously non-blocking (advisory). Now: proposals failing metric validation receive `status: rejected_metric_gate` and are excluded from `enriched_proposals` handed to step-04. The cycle continues with passing proposals; cycle-level failure occurs only when zero proposals pass. Rejected proposals surface in the step summary and in the PR body under "Rejected by metric gate". Escape hatch via `meta_optimize.metric_gate: advisory` in `hive.config.yaml` restores the legacy non-blocking behavior.
- **`.github/workflows/hive-dispatch.yml` meta PR base branch retargeted to `develop` (mir-1, 3.6).** Meta-meta nightly PRs previously targeted `main` via the default-branch lookup; they now explicitly target `develop` to respect the `develop`-as-staging-trunk convention. Merged via develop→main release PRs like every other feature.
- **`hive/GUIDE.md`** — new "Configuration Knobs (`meta_optimize:`)" subsection documents `signal_weights` and `metric_gate`, replaces the stale "no public `meta_optimize:` block shipped yet" note.
- **`hive/references/meta-optimize-maintainer.md`** — adds "Metric Gate" and "Meta-Shotgun Cycle" sections.
- **`multica-bootstrap`** defaults `mcp_config` to `null` instead of `{}` so Multica's config-merge path doesn't observe an empty object as an override.
- **`multica-story-dispatch/custom-env.mjs`** resolves `~`, `${HOME}`, `$HOME` in `custom_env` values before sending to Multica (carried forward from PR #220 / 2.8.0 Fixes).

### Fixed

- **CodeRabbit batch 2 review findings on release PR #226** — assorted lint + correctness fixes blocking release.
- **YAML + markdown lint errors blocking release PR #226** — `chore(lint)` pass.
- **`hive-dispatch.yml`** — retargets PRs from `main` → `develop` (alongside the workflow change above).
- **`story-status-reconcile`** — PR body rewritten via heredoc so multiline content survives shell quoting.
- **CodeRabbit findings on PR #219** (story-loop-closure) and PR #224 (meta-improvement-reset) addressed.

### Notes

- **Multica substrate is the default execution path going forward.** Sandcastle + GH-Actions remain available; their archival is scheduled in `sandcastle-adoption-followon`.
- **KG signal repair** is **not** in scope; `kg_signal` weight stays at `0.4` pending the dedicated KG-revival epic.
- The `advisory` escape hatch for `metric_gate` is intentional — allows shipping proposals whose metric is hard to formalize without blocking the cycle.
- All surface changes are additive or have opt-out escape hatches. **No breaking changes** to the public `/execute`, `/plan`, `/test`, or `/meta-optimize` consumer paths.
- `multica-plan-test-cycles` planning artifacts ship with this release; the 11 implementation stories (PLU-154..164) execute via Multica in the next cycle.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- `/hive:context-snapshot` skill emits a versioned JSON snapshot of Hive state (branch, epics, stories via `deriveStoryStatus`, recent episodes, open triage, metric verdicts) for consumption by external coordinators (Hermes, custom scheduler integrations, etc.). Read-only, transport-agnostic (stdout default, optional `--write` to `.pHive/context-snapshot.json`).
- `hive/lib/context-snapshot.mjs` library composer (`composeContextSnapshot`) — reusable across consumers without going through the skill surface.
- `hive/references/context-snapshot-schema.md` documents the versioned JSON shape with additive-only versioning rule.
- `/hive:standup --format slack` flag emits Phase 1 standup report in Slack-friendly markdown (no ANSI, code-block tables, no interactive prompts) suitable for cron capture + Slack delivery.
- `hive/references/standup-slack-format.md` documents the slack output conventions.
- `/hive:triage --json` flag emits machine-parseable envelopes for every sub-command (`--list`, single-id inspect, create, `--advance`, `--hand-off`, `--close`). Single-writer invariant on `queue.yaml` preserved — `--json` only changes output formatting, never adds write paths.
- `skills/triage/run.mjs` CLI runner backing the triage skill with full state-machine implementation, queue read/write, and JSON envelopes.

### Changed

- `hive/references/routines-integration.md` adds §"External coordinators (Hermes equivalence)" noting that any cron/webhook-capable coordinator (Anthropic Routines, Hermes, custom) plugs into the standup skill via the same scheduler-as-trigger contract.
- `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-multica/SKILL.md` adds explicit checkout + verify + fail-fast (mi-03).
- `hive/lib/multica-bootstrap/index.mjs` + `hive/lib/multica-agents-config/index.mjs` install Claude Code plugins via `custom_env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_PATH` (mi-04).

### Fixed

- `hive/lib/multica-story-dispatch/custom-env.mjs` (new) resolves `~`, `${HOME}`, and `$HOME` in `custom_env` values before sending to Multica, so plugin paths reach the agent literally (ab17b0b, PR #220).

### Notes

- Substrate for the planned Hermes-as-external-supervisor integration (companion epic `hermes-bridge-mvp` in `~/Code/hermes-agent` planned separately). All three flags are additive opt-in surfaces — default behavior is byte-equivalent on every existing entry point.
- Bundles `multica-integration-fixes` epic (PR #220, merged before this release): mi-01/mi-02 spikes documented in `.pHive/upstream-watch/`, mi-03/mi-04 + custom-env-resolve fix shipped above.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Multica dispatch mode for `/execute`: `execution.mode: multica` or `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE=multica` routes each story as a Multica issue assignment to the `developer` persona. The v1 contract is whole-story-to-one-agent, with one `multica-run.yaml` episode marker per story.
- `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-multica/SKILL.md` atomic dispatch sub-skill.
- `hive/lib/multica-story-dispatch/` helper exports: `serializeStoryBrief`, `resolveAgentUuidByName`, `ensureIssueBriefMatches`, `dispatchStoryToAgent`, and `moveOutOfBacklogIfNeeded` from `index.mjs`; `pollTaskUntilTerminal` and `writeMulticaRunEpisode` from `episode-sync.mjs`.
- `tests/smoke/multica-execute-mode.test.mjs` first dogfood smoke against the live Multica spike, gated on `/healthz`.

### Changed

- `skills/hive/skills/execute-dispatch/SKILL.md` adds `multica` to the `mode_decision` enum, documents override precedence, and recognizes the mode in Step 1.5 parallel-gate handling. `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE` wins over config on conflict, and the existing Sandcastle branch remains unchanged at line level.

### Notes

- Additive opt-in only: default execution mode remains sequential and this is not a breaking change.
- Sandcastle + GH-Actions paths remain available and are scheduled for archival in `sandcastle-adoption-followon`.
- v1 scope is intentional: whole-story-to-one-agent, polling not SSE, fail-loud bootstrap precondition, and per-phase markers plus sidecar routing deferred to v2 work.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- `/hive:multica-init` bootstrap skill (s3).
- Multica task-tracking adapter (s1).
- Persona → Multica agent declarative config (s4).
- `/plan` Phase D Multica dispatch wiring (s2).
- `GUIDE.md` maintainer guide for the Multica execution model.

### Changed

- README setup pointer now leads with `/hive:multica-init`.
- `hive.config.yaml` gains commented `# Multica (built-in):` example block.

### Notes

- Sandcastle + GH-Actions execution paths remain available but are scheduled for archival in follow-on cleanup epic `sandcastle-adoption-followon`.
- No breaking changes in this release — minor bump (2.5.0 → 2.6.0).
- Consumers do not need to take action unless they want to adopt the Multica substrate (run `/hive:multica-init`).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-19

**Pre-built sandcastle container image distributed via GHCR — dispatch cold-start drops from ~4 min to ~20 s.**

The `Hive dispatch` workflow no longer builds the sandcastle container inside each run. A new `build-sandcastle-image.yml` workflow publishes the image to GitHub Container Registry on every `.sandcastle/**` push (plus a weekly cron for base-image CVE refresh), and dispatch pulls it on demand. A local-build fallback keeps dispatch unblocked when the image isn't yet published or GHCR is unreachable.

### Added

- **`build-sandcastle-image.yml` — new workflow at `.github/workflows/build-sandcastle-image.yml` (gi-1)** that builds the sandcastle container image (mirroring the cron `Hive Worker`'s proven local-build pattern: claude-code + codex + plugin-hive marketplace shims) and pushes both `:latest` and `:sha-<7>` tags to `ghcr.io/firefly-events/sandcastle`. Triggers on push to main with `paths: ['.sandcastle/**']`, `workflow_dispatch`, and a weekly cron (`'17 4 * * 0'`, Sunday 04:17 UTC) that refreshes the image to catch Debian base-image CVE fixes. Uses `docker/build-push-action@v5` with `cache-from: type=gha` + `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max` so cross-run builds reuse the BuildKit layer cache. A smoke step runs `which claude && which codex && claude --version` inside the freshly-pushed `:sha-<7>` image — non-zero exit fails the run and the immutable `:sha-<7>` tag serves as a rollback target. Requires `permissions: { contents: read, packages: write }`.

### Changed

- **`Hive dispatch` workflow now pulls from GHCR instead of building (gi-2).** The scaffolder template (`skills/sandcastle-gh-init/assets/hive-dispatch.yml.tpl`), its `.example.yml` mirror, and the in-repo `.github/workflows/hive-dispatch.yml` gained a new `Pull sandcastle image (with local-build fallback)` step between `Install dependencies` and `Resolve base branch`. The step runs `docker pull "${IMAGE_REF}"` (default `ghcr.io/firefly-events/sandcastle:latest`), retags the result as `sandcastle:hive` to preserve the bridge's `@ai-hero/sandcastle` `docker()` lookup contract, and falls back to an in-workflow `docker build .sandcastle` (with the same `AGENT_UID`/`AGENT_GID` build-args used by the cron worker) only when the pull returns non-zero. A new `workflow_dispatch.inputs.image_ref` knob lets maintainers pin a specific `:sha-<7>` tag for rollback testing. Net effect: dispatch cold-start drops from ~4 min (local build) to ~20 s (warm GHCR pull) for the normal path; the fallback preserves the legacy behavior with no regression.
- **Runbook `hive/references/sandcastle-gh-dispatch.md` (gi-3)** gains a new §4 "Image distribution" section covering default behavior, the `image_ref` override knob, the local-build fallback, first-time setup (manually trigger `build-sandcastle-image.yml` once after enabling), image rebuild cadence (push to `.sandcastle/**` + weekly cron), and image visibility (public by default; private adds a `docker login` step). Sections 5-9 renumbered accordingly; internal cross-references updated.
- **README "Unattended mode" section** gains a one-paragraph summary of the GHCR image flow with a deep-link to the new runbook section.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **`Hive dispatch` workflow + sandcastle bridge migrated to Claude OAuth (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`).** The default authentication path for `/hive:sandcastle-gh-init`-scaffolded workflows is now the long-lived headless OAuth token generated by `claude setup-token` — billed against the maintainer's Claude subscription, no per-token API charges. Proven by the `.github/workflows/claude-auth-spike.yml` smoke test on 2026-05-17. `@ai-hero/sandcastle`'s `claudeCode()` provider does not hardcode an auth env-var name; it forwards the workflow-step env into the container, and the `claude` CLI itself reads `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` directly — no file mount or aliasing required.
  - `--secret-mode` now accepts `claude-oauth` (the new default), `anthropic-api` (legacy pay-per-token), and `openai` (unchanged). The deprecated alias `anthropic` continues to work and resolves to `anthropic-api`, with a one-line deprecation warning on stderr so consumers can migrate.
  - `.github/workflows/hive-dispatch.yml` (in-repo) + the rendered `.github/scripts/sandcastle-hive-bridge.mts` now reference `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The scaffolder template + .example mirrors emit the same default; existing consumers' rendered files keep working — but to migrate to OAuth they should re-run `/hive:sandcastle-gh-init`, set the new repo secret via `gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, and remove the old `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret.
  - Runbook `hive/references/sandcastle-gh-dispatch.md` §4 gains a new §4.1 "Generating the Claude OAuth token" subsection covering `claude setup-token` → `gh secret set` end-to-end. Rotation procedure updated to cover all three secret modes.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **`Hive dispatch` workflow no longer crashes on bare repos.** The `Install dependencies` step in `hive-dispatch.yml` (both the in-repo workflow and the scaffolder template + .example mirror) used `npm ci`, which requires a `package-lock.json`. Plugin-hive itself (and any consumer following the BYO-deps pattern) ships no lockfile, so the step exited non-zero before the bridge could start, leaving labeled issues stuck (issue #137 hit this on 2026-05-19). Replaced with a three-case conditional: lockfile present → `npm ci`; `package.json` only → `npm install --no-save`; no `package.json` → `npm install --no-save --no-package-lock @ai-hero/sandcastle` (bare-repo transient). Re-enable the workflow via `gh workflow enable "Hive dispatch"` once this patch is live.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-19

**Per-epic branch + stacked-PR dispatch — `feat/<epic-id>` against configurable base, one PR per epic.**

The sandcastle-gh-dispatch surface (added in 2.3.0 / refined in 2.3.1 + 2.3.2) now stacks stories of the same epic onto a single branch and produces one PR per epic — instead of the legacy one-branch-per-issue + one-PR-per-issue path. Aligns with the established `feedback_git_flow_per_epic.md` policy memory.

### Added

- **`git_flow` config block + `resolveGitFlow` helper (pe-1).** New top-level block in `hive.config.yaml` with `default_pr_base: auto` (auto = `develop` if `origin/develop` exists, else `main`) and `branch_strategy: per-epic` (the new default; `per-story` is retained for back-compat). Resolution helper lives at `hive/lib/git_flow.mjs`; read root-first per `hive/references/skill-prelude.md`, with array-form `execFileSync` only (no shell interpolation). Returns `{ base_branch, branch_strategy, source }`.
- **Sandcastle bridge derives branch from `hive:epic:` label (pe-2).** `skills/sandcastle-gh-init/assets/sandcastle-hive-bridge.mts.tpl` now fetches issue labels via the GitHub REST API (no `child_process`), looks for a `hive:epic:<id>` label, and dynamically imports `hive/lib/git_flow.mjs` to read the resolved `branch_strategy`. Branch becomes `feat/<epic-id>` when epic-labeled + `per-epic`; falls back to `agent/issue-<n>` otherwise. Structured stdout result now also reports `epicId` and `branchStrategy` for downstream verification.
- **Dispatch workflow gains per-epic concurrency + PR open-or-update (pe-3).** `skills/sandcastle-gh-init/assets/hive-dispatch.yml.tpl` restructured into a two-job graph: an upstream `derive` job extracts `EPIC_ID` from `${{ toJSON(github.event.issue.labels) }}` via `jq` (label payload never reaches a shell word), and the heavy `run` job declares `needs: derive` and reads `concurrency.group: ${{ needs.derive.outputs.concurrency_key }}` (resolves to `hive-epic-<id>` for epic stories, `hive-issue-<n>` for non-epic fallback). A new `Resolve base branch` step imports the pe-1 helper at runtime. The success step now queries for an existing open PR on `feat/<epic-id>` and either creates a fresh `--draft` PR (first story) or `gh pr edit --body` the existing one (later stories), composing bodies via `jq -nr --arg` so user-controlled issue titles are JSON-encoded; bodies are truncated at 25 story entries with a "see commits" pointer.
- **Draft PR promotes to ready on last story (pe-4).** New `Promote PR to ready if last story` workflow step counts `hive:epic:<id>` + `hive:story:*` story issues (`hive:story:*` filter excludes any epic-tracker issue) against `hive:epic:<id>` + `hive:shipped` + state-closed shipped issues; on parity it calls `gh pr ready "feat/<epic-id>"`. A `0/0` count is treated as a label-propagation anomaly and does NOT promote — zero false-positive ready flips. Step is gated on `success() && needs.derive.outputs.epic_id != ''` so non-epic runs never attempt promotion.
- **`/plan` pins resolved `git_flow` on `epic.yaml` (pe-5).** Phase A gains a new step `0a. Pre-flight: resolve git_flow (pe-5)` that calls `resolveGitFlow({ cwd })` immediately after the kickoff gate and persists the result on the planning context as `${git_flow_resolution}`. Phase C step 15's emitted `epic.yaml` now includes a top-level `git_flow:` block with both `base_branch` and `branch_strategy` resolved at plan time (pinning ensures downstream dispatch runs use the same value even if config drifts). Re-plan is idempotent — existing blocks update in place, missing ones insert after `methodology:`. Schema documented in new `hive/references/story-yaml-schema.md` §5 "Epic index (`epic.yaml`)" with field table, pinning rationale, and back-compat note.
- **Runbook documentation (pe-6).** New "Branching model" section (§3) in `hive/references/sandcastle-gh-dispatch.md` documenting default behavior, the override knob, the `per-story` back-compat path, concurrency semantics (epic-scoped), and PR lifecycle (draft → ready on last shipped). README "Unattended mode" section gains a per-epic flow paragraph linking to the new runbook section.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **`/hive:sandcastle-gh-init` prereq accepts `.sandcastle/Containerfile`** in addition to `.sandcastle/Dockerfile`. Sandcastle 0.5.x ships a Podman-style `Containerfile` by default, so the previous Dockerfile-only check rejected validly-initialized repos with a misleading `Sandcastle is not initialized` exit-2. Both names are valid OCI build files; either now satisfies the prereq. Affects `scaffold.mjs` prereq check, `SKILL.md` prereq doc, runbook section 1, and adds a new `AC-1b` test that seeds `.sandcastle/Containerfile` and asserts the scaffold completes. Closes #171.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Skill discovery path** for `/hive:sandcastle-gh-init` — moved from `skills/hive/skills/sandcastle-gh-init/` (atomic/internal nesting) to `skills/sandcastle-gh-init/` (top-level). Top-level layout is required for plugin discovery to register the user-facing slash command. Affects scaffold script path, SKILL.md self-references, tests, and the runbook. Plugin manifest version bumped 2.3.0 → 2.3.1.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-18

**Event-driven autonomous dispatch — `hive:ready` label fires `/hive:execute` inside Sandcastle.**

Replaces the 15-minute cron polling cadence introduced in 2.1.0 with a label-trigger workflow. Labeling an issue `hive:ready` immediately fires a GitHub Actions run that executes the story inside a Sandcastle container, opens a PR, and flips the canonical label state machine. Reuses the existing `hive:ready` / `hive:in-flight` / `hive:shipped` / `hive:failed` labels — no schema or label changes — so the cron loop and event-driven dispatch can coexist on the same repo.

### Added

- **New public skill `/hive:sandcastle-gh-init`** (`skills/sandcastle-gh-init/`). Scaffolds GitHub Actions event-trigger glue on top of an already-initialized `.sandcastle/` setup. Drops three managed files into the consumer repo via a single `chore(hive): wire github-issue dispatch via sandcastle` commit. Args: `--runner ubuntu-latest|self-hosted`, `--secret-mode anthropic|openai`, `--force-recover`. Refuses to write if `.sandcastle/Dockerfile` is absent (run `npx sandcastle init` first); warns non-blocking on missing canonical labels and prints copy-pasteable `gh label create` commands. Uses `child_process.execFile` array-form invocations throughout — user-supplied args cannot smuggle shell metacharacters.
- **New workflow template** `.github/workflows/hive-dispatch.yml` (shipped as a skill asset at `skills/sandcastle-gh-init/assets/hive-dispatch.yml.tpl`). Triple-guards the dispatch trigger via `on: issues:[labeled]` + step-level `if: github.event.label.name == 'hive:ready'` + per-issue `concurrency.group`. Workflow YAML owns every label transition (`if: failure()` covers bridge crashes — load-bearing invariant that prevents stuck `hive:in-flight` labels). Sets `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE: team` to prevent nested sandcastles in the inner Hive run.
- **New bridge script** `.github/scripts/sandcastle-hive-bridge.mts` (shipped at `skills/sandcastle-gh-init/assets/sandcastle-hive-bridge.mts.tpl`). Thin `sandcastle.run()` wrapper invoking `claudeCode("claude-opus-4-7")` with the docker sandbox factory, branch strategy `agent/issue-<n>`, `maxIterations: 5`, `idleTimeoutSeconds: 600`. Prompt body explicitly instructs the inner Hive not to invoke `/hive:plan` (human's responsibility) and not to spawn nested sandcastles.
- **New maintainer runbook** [`hive/references/sandcastle-gh-dispatch.md`](hive/references/sandcastle-gh-dispatch.md). Seven numbered procedures: install the dispatch surface, label state machine, secret rotation, runner switch (Podman/self-hosted), public-repo label-permission lockdown, future-labels extension point (where to wire `hive:plan` / `hive:test` / `hive:review` when scoped), and stuck `hive:in-flight` label debugging (workflow run inspection, sandcastle container logs, common bridge failures).
- **Reuse of existing label state machine.** The four canonical labels — `hive:ready`, `hive:in-flight`, `hive:shipped`, `hive:failed` — are unchanged from 2.1.0. No new labels introduced. Topic labels (`hive:epic:<id>`, `hive:story:<id>`, `hive:blocked-by:<id>`) coexist and are orthogonal.

### Notes

- The cron-based loop from 2.1.0 (`.github/workflows/hive-worker.yml` + `hive/lib/budget-gate.js`) is unchanged and continues to ship. Event-driven dispatch is an additional surface, not a replacement — consumers can adopt either or both.
- `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE: team` is the single-isolation-layer guard: the outer Sandcastle container is the isolation boundary; the inner Hive must not nest another one.
- Plugin version bumped 2.2.0 → 2.3.0 (consumer-visible new skill).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-15

**Sandcastle ops layer — autonomous-execution loop on top of sandcastle (opt-in).**

Closes the cron → worker → PR → review loop by composing three things that already existed (`/plan`, sandcastle, GitHub Actions) rather than building a new dispatcher. All opt-in via `external_task_tracking.adapter: github` + sandcastle adoption + a maintainer-only workflow in plugin-hive's own `.github/`. Zero behavior change for default consumers.

### Added

- **S1 — GitHub Issues label-pass adapter + `/plan` step 19a** (`hive/lib/external/github-issues-adapter.js`). Story-YAML → `gh issue create` with `hive:story` + `hive:ready` labels; idempotent on `slug` body marker. Wired into `skills/plan/SKILL.md` step 19a as the consumer-visible publish seam when `external_task_tracking.adapter: github`. Adapter is BYO `octokit` — no root dependency added.
- **S2 — Sandcastle worker prompt + Zod result schema + runner** (`.sandcastle/prompts/worker-issue-pickup.md`, `hive/lib/sandcastle-worker-schema.js`, `hive/lib/sandcastle-worker-runner.js`). Worker reads `hive:ready` issues, picks the oldest, re-reads canonical story YAML from disk (issue body is snapshot only), implements, opens PR, comments back. `Output.object()` typed via Zod so `result.json` is contract-checked. Test seam exposed via `_deps` for unit testing without booting a container.
- **S3 — GH Actions cron workflow + token-budget gate** (`.github/workflows/hive-worker.yml`, `hive/lib/budget-gate.js`, `tests/budget-gate.test.js`). 15-minute cron + `workflow_dispatch` with optional `issue_number` input; `concurrency: hive-worker, cancel-in-progress: false` serializes runs. Pre-flight `node hive/lib/budget-gate.js` sums today's spend from `.pHive/metrics/events/stop-*.jsonl` (per-model rate-card, opus fallback for unknown models, malformed-row tolerant) and aborts the run when over `tokens.daily_usd_limit`. Stuck-in-flight safety net labels the issue `hive:failed` when the worker exits non-zero without `status: shipped`. Workflow is REFERENCE/maintainer-only — consumers copy it into their own repo (plugins distribute via `.claude-plugin/`, not `.github/`).
- **New reference doc** `hive/references/sandcastle-ops-loop.md` — end-to-end flow, opt-in instructions, constraints, config keys.

### Notes

- Pricing rate-card in `hive/lib/budget-gate.js` is intentionally inline so rate drift shows up in diffs; verify against Anthropic's current pricing before relying on absolute spend numbers.
- 15-minute cron cadence is a default, not a load-tested number — tune via the workflow's `cron:` field after the first observation window.
- Metrics contract: `autonomous_stories_closed` (target 3, window 14d post-merge, source `gh_issue_close_events`) per the S3 story metric block. Verifiable at epic-close + 14d.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-15

**Patch release.** Merges three nightly `meta-meta-optimize` cycle ledger appends (2026-05-13, -14, -15) into `main`. No code or workflow changes — operational state only.

### Added

- `.pHive/meta-team/ledger.yaml` — 3 new cycle entries (meta-2026-05-13, -14, -15). Cycle meta-2026-05-13 promoted 1 SCHEMA_INCONSISTENCY fix to `step-03-proposal.md` (NEXT STEP pointer correction); meta-2026-05-14 and meta-2026-05-15 closed as discard cycles (hive-cloud-roadmap.md STUB_DOC repeatedly flagged out_of_scope pending Hive Cloud epic activation).

### Changed

- `.pHive/meta-team/cycle-state.yaml`, `.pHive/meta-team/morning-summary.md` — rolled forward through nightly cycles.
- `hive/workflows/steps/meta-team-cycle/step-03-proposal.md` — NEXT STEP pointer corrected from `step-04-implementation.md` to `step-03c-metric-declaration.md` per meta-2026-05-13 finding.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-12

**Hive 2.0 milestone.** Cut from `dev/hive-2.0`. Bundles CWC 2026 A-group + Epic A (catalog hygiene + 3 mattpocock-aligned borrows) + Epic B (structural refactor + gate-lift) + Epic C (Task-Tracking Adapter ABI) as the 2.0 cut-line, with Epic D (Sandcastle adoption follow-on) and Epic F (UI cluster extract-config deeper) riding parallel.

Brand reframe: from *"director's chair"* (Hive directs swarms) to *"composable substrate, user-directed"* (user directs Hive; Hive provides composable atoms + workflow primitives). See `recommendation.md:239-241`.

### Added

- **Epic A — Catalog hygiene + borrows** (PR #58, 13 stories, W0-W5). W0 boilerplate extraction; W1 doc-template reclassify; mattpocock-aligned borrows (CONTEXT.md, atomic-shape audit, grill-before-plan).
- **Epic B — Structural refactor + gate-lift** (PR #62, 14 stories, W6). Plan/execute skill split; `paths.gate_mode` knob (`hard` vs `warning`); post-run audit + gate-lift telemetry under `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/audits/post-run/<run-id>.yaml`; 5-cluster brand/design/polish/visual-qa extract-config (3 of 5 cluster members thinned).
- **Epic C — Task-Tracking Adapter ABI** (PR #63, 7 stories, W1-W5). Hierarchy-agnostic ABI under `hive/lib/task-tracking-dispatch/`; reference adapters for GitHub Issues + Linear under `hive/adapters/{github,linear}/`; JSON schemas under `hive/references/task-tracking-adapter-abi-schemas/`; migration guide + prose-runbook deprecation; plan-skill Phase D (publish stories to tracker) + execute-skill step 7b (status updates) wired through dispatch; `gate_mode` + prose-runbook-fallback telemetry.
- **Epic D — Sandcastle adoption follow-on** (PR #66, 12 specs / 7 slices). Sandcastle as 5th `execute` mode; provider wrapper at `hive/lib/sandcastle-provider.js` with preflight semver pin (`>=0.5.10 <0.6.0`); log-line redaction at `hive/lib/sandcastle-log-redaction.js` (argv/env, bearer, JSON-kv forms); V1 hooks reference; `gate-claudecode-sandcastle.mjs` policy gate scanning `.js/.mjs/.cjs/.ts/.mts/.cts` for `sandcastle + claudeCode()` blocked-lane usage; adoption guide at `hive/references/sandcastle-adoption-guide.md`; issue #191 defer marker + warm-pool placeholder; specialist-phase security plan-audit + performance audit trail.
- **Epic F — UI cluster extract-config deeper** (PR #65, 4 stories). D2 full closure. 6 public reference files under `hive/references/ui-prompts/` (`brand-system`, `design-system`, `polish-audit`, `visual-qa`, `design-review-design-critique`, `design-review-synthesis`); `step_file:` loading support in `skills/design-review/SKILL.md` (precedence `step_file` > `task` per `hive/references/workflow-schema.md:39`); regression-gate documentation at `hive/references/ui-prompt-extraction-verification.md`.

### Changed

- `skills/brand-system/SKILL.md`, `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`, `skills/polish-audit/SKILL.md`, `skills/visual-qa/SKILL.md` — inline ui-designer task bodies replaced with load → cite → inject → spawn invocation envelopes. Net -125 lines (109→72, 89→75, 162→134, 128→82).
- `hive/workflows/design-review.workflow.yaml` — design-critique + synthesis steps use `step_file:` instead of inline `task:` (5750 → 3698 bytes, -2052).
- `skills/plan/SKILL.md` — added Phase D (step 19 tracker publish) + step 20 (post-run audit).
- `skills/execute/SKILL.md` — added step 7b (tracker status update) + expanded step 8 (post-run audit with backend resolution sources).

### Fixed

- CodeRabbit findings on PR #65 (CHANGELOG footer link map; `{artifact_target}` placeholder docs) and PR #66 (`RE_ARGV` case-insensitive `/gi`, `parseSemver` `$` anchor, `.cts` in `SCAN_EXTS`, `userns: false` security-default clarification, `printenv | podman` anti-pattern guidance corrected).

### Notes

- **2.0 cut-line** per `.pHive/epics/hive-composability-audit/docs/recommendation.md:432` = CWC 2026 A-group + Epic A + B + C merged.
- **Post-2.0 follow-ons** queued: Epic G (`memory-stack-optionalize`, discretionary) and Epic H (`brand-system-2.0-update`, auto-triggered on 2.0 merge).
- Epic E (`atoshell-reconsider`) remains dormant — trigger requires explicit user reopen.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- 6 new public reference files under `hive/references/ui-prompts/`: `brand-system`, `design-system`, `polish-audit`, `visual-qa`, `design-review-design-critique`, and `design-review-synthesis`.
- `step_file:` loading support in `skills/design-review/SKILL.md` step-execution loop. Precedence is `step_file` > `task`, per `hive/references/workflow-schema.md:39`.
- `hive/references/ui-prompt-extraction-verification.md` regression-gate documentation.

### Changed

- `skills/brand-system/SKILL.md`, `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`, `skills/polish-audit/SKILL.md`, and `skills/visual-qa/SKILL.md` inline ui-designer task bodies replaced with load -> cite -> inject -> spawn invocation envelopes. No behavior change; net -125 lines across the four:
  - `skills/brand-system/SKILL.md`: 109 -> 72 (-37)
  - `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`: 89 -> 75 (-14)
  - `skills/polish-audit/SKILL.md`: 162 -> 134 (-28)
  - `skills/visual-qa/SKILL.md`: 128 -> 82 (-46)
- `hive/workflows/design-review.workflow.yaml` design-critique and synthesis steps now use `step_file:` instead of inline `task:`. Two specialist steps, accessibility-critique and animations-critique, keep inline `task:` content. Workflow size changed from 5750 -> 3698 bytes (-2052 bytes).
- `skills/design-review/SKILL.md` gained the `step_file:` loading extension code (+287 bytes).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **Session runtime CodeRabbit pass (PR #50 follow-up).** Resolves all
  8 inline findings filed against the memory-autonomy Phase 2 session
  execution path. Behavior unchanged for `sessions.enabled: false`
  (the default), but every fix is correctness-relevant once the
  feature is opted in.
  - `hive/lib/session-client.js` — `sendEvents()` now calls
    `client.beta.sessions.events.send()` (the actual SDK method)
    instead of the non-existent `events.create()`. Would have thrown
    `TypeError` on the first tool turn.
  - `hive/scripts/session-invoke.mjs` — extracted
    `handleRequiresAction()` and `drainStream()` helpers; the SSE
    flow now loops tool turns until a terminal `complete` is observed
    (capped at `MAX_TOOL_TURNS=16`). Previously a session with a
    nested `requires_action` was silently marked `completed` after the
    first tool round and the episode YAML was written without the
    unanswered turn.
  - `hive/lib/session-registry.js` — `acquireLock()` now PID-stamps
    the sentinel file and detects dead holders via
    `process.kill(pid, 0)`, unlinking and retrying immediately.
    Prevents a single crash from degrading the registry to permanent
    fail-open.
  - `hive/lib/session-episode-writer.js` — episode filenames include
    a 12-char sanitized `session_id` suffix
    (`<step_id>-<suffix>.yaml`); stuck-retry no longer overwrites the
    prior failed attempt's episode YAML.
  - `hive/lib/session-prompt-builder.js` — `KG_SQLITE_PATH` uses
    `os.homedir()` instead of `process.env.HOME || '~'` (Windows
    safe; no literal `~` paths).
  - `hive/lib/session-registry.js` — `upsert` insert-path pins
    `session_id` last in the spread, mirroring the update-path's
    ordering.
  - `hive/references/session-registry-schema.md` — re-aligned the
    ASCII lifecycle diagram so the `stuck` arrow visually originates
    under `active`, not `pending`.
  - `hive/references/session-resilience.md` — opening paragraph now
    references `step 6c` (matching line 8 + the References section);
    the previous `step 6b` collided with `cmux`'s 6b in main.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Session-based execution path (memory-autonomy Phase 2).** New
  opt-in `/v1/sessions` runtime brings session-aware story execution
  to the `execute` skill as a top-priority mode. Ships a session
  registry at `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/sessions/index.yaml`
  (`pending|active|completed|failed|stuck`) plus six lib modules
  (`session-client`, `session-episode-writer`, `session-prompt-builder`,
  `session-registry`, `session-sse-reader`, `session-turn-builder`),
  the `hive/scripts/session-invoke.mjs` driver, and an SSE
  stuck-detection + retry contract that replaces respawn for session
  execution. Default OFF; consumers opt in via
  `sessions.enabled: true` in `hive.config.yaml` or
  `HIVE_SESSIONS_ENABLED=1`. The existing TeamCreate path
  (step 6 / 6b cmux) is preserved unchanged.
- **`hive/references/session-registry-schema.md`** and
  **`hive/references/session-resilience.md`** — schema + resilience
  contracts for the new path.
- **`skills/hive/skills/session-registry/SKILL.md`** — bootstrap skill
  for the registry.

### Changed
- `skills/execute/SKILL.md` — adds `step 6c` session execution block;
  routes session sidecar injection through main's `appends[]` map and
  the canonical `specialist-triggers.md` catalog.
- `skills/hive/skills/respawn/SKILL.md` — callout that respawn does
  not apply under the session execution path.
- `hive/references/configuration.md` — documents the new `sessions.*`
  config block.
- `README.md` — version badge bumped to 1.2.1; ToC, revised North
  Star, and QRSPI inspiration link landed via PR #47.

### Chores
- Backfill `integrate.yaml` episode stamps for all 13
  `hive-dag-executor` stories (`hde-0` through `hde-10`).
- Meta-meta nightly cycle for 2026-05-07 (telemetry + ledger).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Hive DAG executor v1 — cutover complete.** The deterministic DAG
  executor (`hive/lib/dag_executor/`) graduates from optional opt-in to
  the target runtime for workflows. 11 of 11 built-in workflows are now
  in the per-workflow graduation registry at
  `.pHive/runtime/executor-graduated-workflows.yaml`:
  `meta-team-cycle`, `code-review`, `performance-audit`, `test-swarm`,
  `development.tdd`, `development.bdd`, `development.tdd-codex`,
  `ui-design`, `design-review`, `development.classic`, `daily-ceremony`.
  Workflows opt in via
  `executor: hive-dag` + `executor_default: true` in
  `.pHive/hive.config.yaml`; default OFF posture preserved for
  consumers that don't flip the flag.
- **PR #31's metric_signal/findings conflation bug class is structurally
  retired.** AND-of-empty routing between `meta-team-cycle`'s
  `proposal` and `backlog-fallback` graduates from prose-narrated
  orchestrator judgement to mechanical YAML predicate evaluation against
  `step-02-analysis`'s declared `output_format` fields (`metric_signal`,
  `findings_count`, `external_candidates_count`).
- **`daily-ceremony` plan-approval gate ships as `node_type: pause`.**
  Operator approval sentinels at
  `<runs_root>/<run_id>/pause/plan-approval.{approve,reject}` carry the
  HMAC-signed token from the `pause_suspended` telemetry event (hde-8
  anti-forgery contract). Existing `step-06-approve-plan.md` is
  preserved as the operator-facing presentation script.
- **`hive/decisions/001-executor-cutover.md`** — canonical migration
  guide for graduating custom workflows; rollout history and sunset
  path for orchestrator-narrated routing; per-workflow rollback
  primitives.
- **`hive/references/story-spec-schema.md`** — minimal schema for the
  `metadata.needs_backend` / `metadata.needs_frontend` story booleans
  consumed by `development.classic`'s YAML-level domain decomposition.

### Changed
- `hive/references/workflow-schema.md` — the existing "Executor Cutover"
  section now also documents authoring-forward defaults: declarative
  `when:` predicates, structured `output_format` blocks, and named
  outputs are recommended for new workflows. Prose-routed workflows
  remain supported under the orchestrator-narrated path
  (maintenance-mode); the path is not removed in this release.
- `hive/GUIDE.md` — adds a "Hive DAG Executor (optional, per-workflow
  opt-in)" section with the consumer opt-in shape and migration guide.
- `hive/MAIN.md` — adds a "Two Execution Paths" architecture note and
  updates the Key References table with predicate-grammar, story-spec,
  and the executor ADR.
## [1.1.4] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **kg_signal proposal source for `/meta-optimize`.** New optional workflow
  step `step-02c-kg-signal.md` queries the L2 knowledge graph for
  `phase_failed`, `phase_blocked`, and `superseded` triples and emits
  `kg-findings.yaml` with `discovery_source: kg_signal`. Three-layer relevance
  filter: predicate vocabulary, recency window, project-tag rank penalty.
- **System-level project registry + KG bootstrap.** New
  `~/.claude/hive/projects.yaml` registry plus
  `scripts/kg-bootstrap-from-projects.js` walks registered project roots and
  seeds `~/.claude/hive/kg.sqlite` with multi-project decision history.
- **step-03 proposal merge accepts kg_signal findings.** Auto-tags untagged
  KG findings with `discovery_source: kg_signal`, dedupes against internal
  grouped findings, and ranks the merged pool.
- **KG-before-backlog routing in meta-optimize.** Precedence is now
  metrics → external research → kg_signal → backlog. Threshold blending,
  new `meta_optimize.kg_signal` config block (`enabled` / `window_days` /
  `cross_project_penalty`); `enabled: false` reverts to the legacy
  metrics → backlog flow. No-op when `kg.sqlite` is absent.
- **End-to-end fixture for kg-augmented-meta-signal.** New
  `tests/fixtures/kg-augmented-meta-signal/` (seed.sql + run.sh + README.md)
  proves the full path with no Node deps — uses system `sqlite3` CLI per
  the bring-your-own-enhancements philosophy. Includes LLM-mediated step-02c
  run, mental-trace through step-03 and meta-optimize routing; all 6 fixture
  ACs verified.
- **OSS rollout brand foundation.** Concept-4 logo (`assets/hive-logo.svg`,
  256/400/512/1024 PNGs and lockup variants), README hero block with
  positioning tagline, Inspirations credit block.
- **README audit for 1.1.3+ drift cleanup.** New "Memory architecture"
  section (L0–L3 tiers + KG + ChromaDB graceful degradation + session-end
  three-op orchestration), Meta Optimization "Proposal sources" rewrite,
  persona count correction, Extensibility path-prefix fixes, cmux row
  description refresh, migration callout.
- **Versioning cross-cutting concern.** New entry in
  `.pHive/cross-cutting-concerns.yaml` requires consumer-visible epics to
  bump `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`, update the README
  badge, and add a CHANGELOG entry. Prevents silent version drift.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Memory & Autonomous Execution Phase 1 — Knowledge Graph (KG) substrate ships.**
  Cross-project, time-versioned decision/lifecycle store at `~/.claude/hive/kg.sqlite`.
  Triples are subject–predicate–object with controlled predicate vocabulary
  (`decided`, `superseded`, `assigned_to`, `blocked_by`, `depends_on`, `phase_started`,
  `phase_complete`, `phase_failed`, `phase_blocked`). WAL-mode SQLite, idempotent
  bootstrap DDL, unique index on `(subject, predicate, object, source_epic)`.
  See `hive/references/knowledge-graph-schema.md`.
- `MemoryStore.query_decisions(filter)` method — point-in-time triple retrieval
  with `entity` / `predicate` / `as_of` / `include_superseded` filters. Documented
  in `hive/references/memory-store-interface.md`.
- KG write path: `kg_write()` in `hive/lib/session-end.js` persists triples at
  session-end and pre-shutdown via the canonical three-op orchestration
  (insights → kg_write → compile ‖ chromadb.index). `INSERT OR IGNORE` with
  runtime `idx_unique_triple` precondition guard.
- KG bootstrap utility: `scripts/kg-import-cycle-state.js` — one-time backfill
  from existing `.pHive/cycle-state/*.yaml`. Atomic transaction wrapping,
  ISO-normalized `valid_from`, dry-run preview, surfaced fallback YAML parse drops.
- KG read path: `agent-spawn` Step 5e injects a "Decision Context" block into
  agent prompts using two `query_decisions({entity})` calls (current_agent +
  current_epic), merged and dedup'd by `(subject, predicate, object, valid_from)`.
- **ChromaDB L3 semantic memory tier (optional).** JSON-RPC wrapper at
  `hive/lib/chromadb-wrapper.js` (`isAvailable()`, `query()`, `index()`),
  agent-namespaced docIds (`${agentName}/${slug}`), graceful degradation to
  L1+L0 when sidecar absent. Indexed at session-end Phase C in parallel with
  `compile()`.
- **Session System Prompt Specification.** Authoritative design at
  `hive/references/session-system-prompt-spec.md` defining session prompt
  composition (persona + prior knowledge + KG decision context + domain note),
  per-step story context injection, session lifecycle, completion detection,
  and cleanup. Foundation for Phase 2 Managed Agent API migration.
- Session-end orchestration skill at `skills/hive/skills/session-end/SKILL.md`
  with three-phase ordering (Phase A insights → Phase B kg_write → Phase C
  compile ‖ chromadb.index), 30-second latency monitoring, asymmetric failure
  handling (KG = surface error, ChromaDB = warn only), and `skipCompile` for
  hard-shutdown pressure.
- Pre-shutdown protocol updated to share the canonical session-end orchestration
  via `runSessionEnd({ skipCompile: true })`.

### Changed
- Memory tier table in `memory-store-interface.md`: L3 row replaces the Qdrant
  placeholder with the actual ChromaDB JSON-RPC wrapper that ships in this release.
- `DecisionFilter.subject?` renamed to `DecisionFilter.entity?` to match the
  canonical SQL placeholder and accurately describe the cross-column matching
  behaviour (`subject = :entity OR object = :entity`).

### Fixed
- `session-end.js`: replaced `process.env.HOME` with `os.homedir()` so paths
  resolve in containerized / sanitized environments.
- `session-end.js`: agent-name and slug input validation (kebab-case regex +
  resolved-path containment) guards ChromaDB indexing against directory
  traversal via crafted inputs.
- `session-end.js` `kgWrite()`: `db.close()` is now guaranteed via try/finally
  even when `sqlite3()` open or `prepare()` setup throws.
- `chromadb-wrapper.js`: `query()` checks HTTP status before parsing the body
  (rejecting 4xx/5xx error payloads); `index()` drains the response body for
  keep-alive cleanliness; dropped unused `metadatas` from `query()` include list.
- `kg-import-cycle-state.js`: real-mode imports now wrap the entire backfill
  in `db.transaction()` for atomicity; fallback YAML parse drops are surfaced
  rather than silently swallowed; dry-run summary renamed to "Would process"
  to remove the optimistic claim that all parsed triples would insert.
- Markdown lint: collapsed multi-space blockquote continuations and removed
  spaces inside code spans across the KG/memory-autonomy stack.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Public `/meta-optimize` skill ships (MVS milestone).** New consumer-facing
  skill that proposes and runs improvement experiments against a user project,
  with PR-only promotion (no direct main mutation), human-edit-only backlog
  fallback at `.pHive/meta-team/queue-meta-optimize.yaml`, and unknown-metric-
  dimension tolerance. See `skills/hive/skills/meta-optimize/SKILL.md` and
  `hive/references/meta-optimize-contract.md`.
- `PrPromotionAdapter` in `hive/lib/meta-experiment/` — concrete PR-artifact
  adapter alongside the maintainer `DirectCommitAdapter`. Close records
  carry explicit `pr_ref` + `pr_state` evidence.
- MVS acceptance proof at `.pHive/audits/mvs-proof/` (canonical + `latest.yaml`
  pointer), 10-item integrity checklist. Regeneration gated behind
  `HIVE_WRITE_MVS_PROOF=1` (see `hive/references/meta-optimize-maintainer.md`).
- `paths.state_dir` config setting (default: `.pHive`) — override to keep
  legacy `state/` or pick any directory name.
- Migration script: `scripts/migrate-state-to-pHive.sh` — renames `state/`
  to `.pHive/` while preserving git history and updating `.gitignore`.
- Kickoff Step 0: detects legacy `state/` directories on existing projects
  and offers in-place migration (or opt-in to keep using `state/`).

### Changed
- **Default state directory renamed `state/` → `.pHive/`.** Hidden by default
  (like `.git/` or `.claude/`). Configurable via `paths.state_dir` in
  `hive.config.yaml` if you prefer a different name.
- All skills and references updated to use `.pHive/` as the default storage
  location for epics, episodes, cycle state, sessions, memories, etc.
- Kickoff gate in every skill now proceeds silently when checks pass — no
  user-visible announcement. The gate still surfaces actionable guidance
  when a check fails.

### Migration
Existing projects with a `state/` directory should migrate. Two supported paths:

1. **Auto-migrate** (recommended): re-run `/hive:kickoff`, choose `yes` at
   the migration prompt.
2. **Manual migrate**: `bash scripts/migrate-state-to-pHive.sh` from your
   project root.

> **Note:** `paths.state_dir` is documented in the config schema but not yet
> wired into runtime path resolution in every skill. If you cannot migrate
> immediately, a symlink (`ln -s state .pHive`) is a safe stopgap. Full
> config-driven path resolution is tracked as follow-up work.

### Known follow-up
Wiring `paths.state_dir` end-to-end requires a single path resolver that
every skill, workflow step, agent domain spec, and hook reads from. Right
now those references hardcode `.pHive/` directly. This is deliberate scope
for this PR (rename + migration tooling + config surface); resolver wiring
will be a dedicated follow-up so the path changes stay reviewable. Until
that lands, any override of `paths.state_dir` other than the default
`.pHive` is best-effort — use the symlink stopgap if you need a different
layout today.

- v2 API annotations in agent-spawn skill (surface.split, surface.send_text,
  surface.read_text, surface.health, surface.close)
- Completion marker convention (`[STORY-COMPLETE:{story-id}]`) for poll-based
  story completion detection
