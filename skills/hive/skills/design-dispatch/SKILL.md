# Hive Design Dispatch

<!-- Structural mirror anchor: skills/hive/skills/execute-dispatch/SKILL.md -->
<!-- Any change to the Step 0/1/1.5/2 logic contract in execute-dispatch must be evaluated for back-propagation here. -->

Atomic skill, NOT inline `/design` prose. It resolves the pre-execution dispatch layer for `/design` and returns the mode and runner decisions the caller switches on. It inherits the caller's model and does not choose or override it.

## Invocation contract

Call this skill once at the single `/design` dispatch point where the caller has both the story execution context and the current workflow handoff context.

**Inputs:** `env` with `HIVE_SESSIONS_ENABLED`, `HIVE_PARALLEL_TEAMS`, `HIVE_TERMINAL_MUX`, and `HIVE_DESIGN_MODE`; parsed root `hive.config.yaml` containing `sessions.enabled`, `parallel_teams` or `execution.parallel_teams`, and `execution.terminal_mux`; parsed consumer `.pHive/hive.config.yaml` or `None`; parsed graduation registry workflow list or `None`; `workflow_name`; `epic_id` when known; `arguments` containing the `--sequential` flag state plus dependency-depth summary; and `unblocked_stories[]` — the depth-0 ready stories at this dispatch tick, each carrying at minimum `id`, `parallel_allowed`, `parallel_rationale`, and (for `parallel_rationale: bounded-slice`) `files_to_modify[]` whose entries name the declared touch-set. Empty or single-element `unblocked_stories[]` is valid: the parallel-dispatch gate (Step 1.5) skips when there is no peer set to gate.

**Outputs:** `mode_decision` enum `sessions | team | team-cmux | sequential | sandcastle | multica | cc-workflows`; `mode_reason` as a one-line string explaining the selected mode; `runner_path` enum `hive-dag | orchestrator-narrated`; `runner_reason` as a one-line string explaining the selected runner path; `field_sources` map covering `sessions_enabled`, `parallel_teams`, `terminal_mux`, `executor`, `execution_mode`, and `execution_runtime` so callers can attribute every resolution; `field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override` as a `<path>` traceability field when a per-epic disposition file overrode the auto heuristic, otherwise `null`; and `gate_violations[]` — a list of `{story_id, reason}` records emitted by Step 1.5 when the parallel-dispatch gate refuses fan-out. `gate_violations[]` is `[]` on healthy runs and on any `mode_decision` other than `team | team-cmux | sessions | sandcastle | multica | cc-workflows`.

`field_sources.execution_mode` tracks the source of an explicit override (sandcastle or multica): `env` when `HIVE_DESIGN_MODE={sandcastle|multica}` wins, `config` when `execution.mode: {sandcastle|multica}` from root `hive.config.yaml` wins, `default` when neither env nor config selects an override (fall-through to the standard mode resolution chain). Its precedence chain is `env > root config > shipped baseline > skill override > default`; current shipped baseline and skill override layers are traceability slots for downstream resolver stories and fall through when absent. Unlike the four existing fields, `execution_mode=default` does NOT trigger the loud "fell to defaults" warning — default is the normal case for non-override runs. The `execution_mode={source}` token is always appended to the telemetry line regardless of source.

`field_sources.execution_runtime` tracks the source of the runtime disposition used by the mode resolver. Its precedence chain is `env > root config > shipped baseline > skill override > default`, with `default` resolving to `auto` when no higher layer selects an explicit runtime. `field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override` is a `<path>` traceability field that records which `.pHive/cycle-state/<epic-id>.yaml` per-epic disposition file overrode the auto heuristic; it is `null` when no per-epic override was applied.

**Side effects:** emit a structured warning only when consumer config sets `executor` to an unknown non-empty value, OR when any of the four tracked fields resolves to `default` (loud no-config warning + telemetry line). Missing consumer config, missing graduation registry, unset `executor`, false `executor_default`, and workflow-not-graduated remain normal fail-closed states and emit no warning for the runner gate itself.

## Input semantics

The mode selection uses these exact match conditions, in precedence order:

1. **Sessions check:** match when `env.HIVE_SESSIONS_ENABLED` is exactly truthy by string normalization (`1`, `true`, or `"true"`) OR root `hive.config.yaml` has `sessions.enabled: true`. This wins over every team or sequential input.
2. **Parallel teams config check:** evaluate the resolved `parallel_teams` boolean from Step 0 below. The legacy reads (root `hive.config.yaml` `parallel_teams` or `execution.parallel_teams`) become the config-source path inside Step 0; this step matches whenever the resolved boolean is `true`.
3. **Concurrency and flag check:** match only when the dependency-depth summary shows more than one story at the same depth AND `arguments` does not contain `--sequential`.

The cmux variant is not a separate team gate. After the parallel config and concurrency checks match, return `team-cmux` when the resolved `terminal_mux` from Step 0 equals `cmux`; otherwise return `team`.

## Sane Defaults

When neither env nor config sets a value, apply these defaults — better baseline for fresh repos per D4 Position A fold-in:

- `parallel_teams` → `true` (collaborative is the better default when more than one story sits at a given depth)
- `terminal_mux` → `tmux` (broadest compat across consumers)
- `sessions_enabled` → `false` (sessions remain opt-in)
- `executor` → `orchestrator-narrated` (fail-closed per Q4 lock; hive-dag requires explicit consumer flag plus registry)

## Process

### Step 0: Resolve Fields with Source Tracking

For each tracked field, apply strict precedence: **env > config > default**. Record the source in `field_sources`. Run this BEFORE Step 1.

For `execution_mode` and `execution_runtime`, record the expanded source chain as **env > root config > shipped baseline > skill override > default**. Root config corresponds to the parsed root `hive.config.yaml`; shipped baseline and skill override are additive source slots that may be populated by downstream resolver stories, and fall through when no value is present.

- `sessions_enabled`:
  - env path: `env.HIVE_SESSIONS_ENABLED` truthy (`1`, `true`, `"true"`) → `true`, source `env`
  - config path: root `hive.config.yaml sessions.enabled: true` → `true`, source `config`
  - default: `false`, source `default`
- `parallel_teams`:
  - env path: `env.HIVE_PARALLEL_TEAMS` truthy → `true`, falsy explicit (`0`, `false`, `"false"`) → `false`, source `env`
  - config path: root `hive.config.yaml parallel_teams` or `execution.parallel_teams` set → that boolean, source `config`
  - default: `true`, source `default`
- `terminal_mux`:
  - env path: `env.HIVE_TERMINAL_MUX` set (non-empty) → that string, source `env`
  - config path: root `hive.config.yaml execution.terminal_mux` set → that string, source `config`
  - default: `tmux`, source `default`
- `executor`:
  - Always read from consumer `.pHive/hive.config.yaml` per Q4 lock. Env never overrides — env path is intentionally absent for this field.
  - config path: consumer config `executor: hive-dag` with `executor_default` truthy → `hive-dag`, source `config`
  - default: `orchestrator-narrated`, source `default`
- `execution_mode`:
  - Resolved via `hive/lib/mode-resolver.mjs` — call `resolveMode('HIVE_DESIGN_MODE', ctx)` where `ctx` is built from the current environment and root config.
  - Call contract: `const { decision, sources } = resolveMode('HIVE_DESIGN_MODE', { env, rootConfig, shippedBaseline, skillOverride })`
  - Returns `{ decision, sources }` where `sources` contains only the winning tier key (e.g. `{ env: 'HIVE_DESIGN_MODE=sandcastle' }` or `{ root_config: 'execution.mode=multica' }` or `{ default: 'auto' }`).
  - When `decision` is `sandcastle` or `multica` (i.e. source is `env` or `root_config`): immediately set `mode_decision={decision}` and `mode_reason=execution-mode-override-{winning-source-key}`. Skip Step 1 entirely. This takes precedence over sessions, team, and sequential.
  - When `decision` is `default` (no env/config/baseline/override matched): fall through to Step 1. `execution_mode=default` does NOT trigger the "fell to defaults" warning — it is the normal non-override path.
  - Always include `execution_mode={winning-source-key}` in the telemetry line.
  - See `hive/lib/mode-resolver.mjs` for the full precedence chain, recognized mode strings, and env-silencing rules.
- `execution_runtime`:
  - Resolved via `hive/lib/mode-resolver.mjs` — call `resolveMode('HIVE_EXECUTION_RUNTIME', ctx)` (note: `HIVE_EXECUTION_RUNTIME` is the env var, not a named-mode varName in the registry).
  - Same 5-tier chain: env > root_config > shipped_baseline > skill_override > default(`auto`).
  - `field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override` is `null` during base resolution and is set to the per-epic cycle-state path only when Step 1 applies an auto-runtime per-epic override.

Env wins over config when both are set for the same field (e.g. `HIVE_DESIGN_MODE=sandcastle` with `execution.mode: multica` — sandcastle wins). This is enforced by `resolveMode` tier ordering.

When ANY of the four fields (`sessions_enabled`, `parallel_teams`, `terminal_mux`, `executor`) resolves with source `default`, emit a loud warning before returning, enumerating each defaulted field and the override path:

```
WARNING: Backend auto-resolved fields fell to defaults — sessions_enabled=false, parallel_teams=true, terminal_mux=tmux, executor=orchestrator-narrated. Override in hive.config.yaml (or env: HIVE_SESSIONS_ENABLED, HIVE_PARALLEL_TEAMS, HIVE_TERMINAL_MUX; executor lives in consumer .pHive/hive.config.yaml).
```

Emit one printable inline telemetry line covering every field resolution:

```
[telemetry] backend_resolution sessions_enabled={source} parallel_teams={source} terminal_mux={source} executor={source} execution_mode={source}
```

### Step 1: Resolve Mode Decision

**Precondition:** only reached when `field_sources.execution_mode=default` (Step 0 did not select sandcastle or multica via env or config). When either override was selected in Step 0, skip this step entirely.

Before emitting `mode_decision`, read `.pHive/cycle-state/<epic-id>.yaml` when `epic_id` is known and inspect its `execution_runtime` block. A missing cycle-state file for an unknown epic is a normal fall-through state for the Phase 5 chicken-and-egg gate: do not hard-error, and continue to the auto heuristic. Per-epic disposition may override only `execution.runtime: auto`; it does NOT override explicit `workflows` or `multica` runtime values from env, root config, shipped baseline, or skill override. On every resolve, emit one INFO log line with the selected mode, source, and applied override path if any.

```pseudo
resolved_runtime, runtime_source = resolve execution_runtime using:
  env > root config > shipped baseline > skill override > default(auto)

epic_override_path = null
if epic_id is known:
  cycle_state_path = ".pHive/cycle-state/<epic-id>.yaml"
  if file exists:
    cycle_state = read YAML(cycle_state_path)
    per_epic_override = cycle_state.execution_runtime.adapter
  else:
    per_epic_override = null  # graceful fall-through for unknown epic; no hard error

if resolved_runtime != "auto" and runtime_source != "default":
  # Explicit runtime override (env / root config / shipped baseline / skill override).
  # Map the runtime value directly to the corresponding mode_decision and skip
  # both the per-epic override path and the auto heuristic below.
  field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override = null
  if resolved_runtime == "workflows":
    mode_decision = "cc-workflows"
  elif resolved_runtime == "multica":
    mode_decision = "multica"
  else:
    # Unknown explicit runtime value — fail-closed back to the auto heuristic
    # so callers see a normal team / sequential resolution instead of crashing.
    # The unknown value still appears on the telemetry line via runtime_source.
    mode_decision = auto heuristic below
  mode_reason = f"execution-runtime-override-{runtime_source}"
  source = runtime_source
elif resolved_runtime == "auto" and per_epic_override is present:
  mode_decision = per_epic_override
  mode_reason = "execution-runtime-epic-override"
  field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override = cycle_state_path
  source = "epic_override"
else:
  # resolved_runtime == "auto" and no per-epic override — fall through to the
  # auto heuristic. Explicit "workflows" / "multica" runtime values are handled
  # by the first branch above and never reach this fall-through.
  field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override = null
  mode_decision = auto heuristic below
  source = runtime_source

INFO [design-dispatch] mode={mode_decision} source={source} epic_override={field_sources.execution_runtime.epic_override|null}
```

When the first branch above selects `mode_decision ∈ {cc-workflows, multica}`, skip the auto heuristic (Step 1 list below) entirely. The explicit runtime value is the final decision; the auto heuristic only runs when `mode_decision = auto heuristic below` was set.

Evaluate in this order and stop at the first selected path:

1. If the sessions check matches, return `mode_decision=sessions` and `mode_reason=sessions-enabled`.
2. If parallel teams config is not true, return `mode_decision=sequential` and `mode_reason=parallel-teams-disabled`.
3. If the dependency-depth summary does not show multiple stories at the same depth, return `mode_decision=sequential` and `mode_reason=no-peer-depth`.
4. If `--sequential` is present in `arguments`, return `mode_decision=sequential` and `mode_reason=sequential-flag`.
5. When the resolved `terminal_mux` field (from Step 0, env > config > default) equals `cmux`, return `mode_decision=team-cmux` and `mode_reason=team-checks-pass-cmux`.
6. Otherwise return `mode_decision=team` and `mode_reason=team-checks-pass`.

This preserves precedence: `sessions > team-cmux > team > sequential`.

### Step 1.5: Parallel-Dispatch Gate (ed-7)

**Precondition:** only reached when `mode_decision ∈ {team, team-cmux, sessions, sandcastle, multica, cc-workflows}` AND `unblocked_stories[]` has length > 1. When `mode_decision` is `sequential`, or when the peer set has fewer than two stories, skip this step entirely — there is no parallel fan-out to gate. The gate also runs when `mode_decision` is `sandcastle`, `multica`, or `cc-workflows` because the provider fans out one assignment per depth-0 story.

The gate refuses parallel dispatch unless **every** story in `unblocked_stories[]` is properly annotated. Default-serial is the contract: a story without explicit opt-in MUST fall back to sequential dispatch. Initialize `gate_violations: []` and evaluate the following checks in order; record one record per offending story and continue (do NOT short-circuit on the first failure — the warning enumerates the full set so a single fix pass resolves all of them).

1. **`parallel_allowed` opt-in check.** For each story whose `parallel_allowed` is absent, `false`, or any value other than the literal boolean `true`: append `{story_id, reason: "parallel_allowed-missing-or-false"}` to `gate_violations[]`. Stories with `parallel_allowed: false` are valid serial stories — they are listed here only because they appear in a fan-out set together with peers; the gate refuses to mix serial and parallel within one dispatch tick.

2. **`parallel_rationale` shape check.** For each story where `parallel_allowed: true`, validate that `parallel_rationale` is present AND its value is exactly one of `variation`, `read-only`, `bounded-slice`. Any other value (missing, `null`, free-form string, typo) is **malformed**: append `{story_id, reason: "parallel_rationale-malformed"}` to `gate_violations[]`. Per [`story-yaml-schema.md`](../../../hive/references/story-yaml-schema.md) §4.3, missing or off-enum rationale is a hard validator-reject; a "parallel_allowed-without-rationale" story never reaches dispatch as if it were valid.

3. **`bounded-slice` touch-set declaration check.** For each story with `parallel_rationale: bounded-slice`, validate that `files_to_modify` is present and non-empty AND every entry resolves to a non-empty string `file:` path. An empty list, missing field, or entries with no `file:` value is malformed for the bounded-slice rationale (only this rationale constrains the file set). Append `{story_id, reason: "bounded-slice-missing-files_to_modify"}`. Stories with `variation` or `read-only` rationale do NOT require a declared touch-set — the gate ignores `files_to_modify` for those rationales.

4. **`bounded-slice` touch-set disjointness check.** Collect every `bounded-slice` story's declared `files_to_modify[*].file` values into per-story sets. Compute pairwise intersections across the bounded-slice subset. For every non-empty intersection, append one record per participating story: `{story_id, reason: "bounded-slice-overlap:<path1>,<path2>,...:<peer_id>"}`. The reason string names the overlapping paths and the peer story whose touch-set collides so the orchestrator's warning surfaces the exact conflict; if a path appears in three or more stories, each colliding pair generates its own record. Touch-set entries are compared as literal strings — the gate does NOT normalize paths (no symlink resolution, no glob expansion, no relative-vs-absolute coercion). Planners declaring `bounded-slice` must use the canonical path form `/plan` writes.

If after all four checks `gate_violations[]` is non-empty: downgrade `mode_decision = sequential` and set `mode_reason = parallel-gate-refused`. Emit a structured warning to stdout that names every offending story ID and reason:

```
WARNING: parallel-dispatch gate refused — falling back to sequential. Offending stories:
  - {story_id_1}: {reason_1}
  - {story_id_2}: {reason_2}
  ...
Fix by editing planning emission (/plan Phase C step 13) or correcting the story YAML; see hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md and hive/references/story-yaml-schema.md §4.
```

If `gate_violations[]` is empty after all four checks: the mode resolved in Step 1 stands. Do not modify `mode_decision` or `mode_reason`. The empty `gate_violations[]` is still returned so callers can branch unconditionally on its length.

> **Telemetry note:** the gate's pass/refuse outcome is captured by the orchestrator's post-run audit (see [`hive/references/gate-lift-telemetry.md`](../../../hive/references/gate-lift-telemetry.md)) via the `gate_violations[]` field on the dispatch return; no separate event emission lives in this skill.
>
> **Scope reminder:** the gate inspects only the depth-0 `unblocked_stories[]` set passed to this skill call. Stories at later dependency depths are gated on their own subsequent dispatch tick when `/design` re-enters this skill for the next peer set. See [`hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md`](../../../hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md) for the catalog of dispatch points subject to this gate.

### Step 2: Resolve Runner Path

Evaluate the deterministic executor cutover as a five-stage decision tree. Default OFF: any miss returns `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated`.

> **WARNING:** Step 2 (this runner-path resolver) reads CONSUMER `.pHive/hive.config.yaml` ONLY for runner flags. Never read shipped `hive/hive.config.yaml` for runner flags — that would regress to pre-Slice-1 contamination.

1. **Read consumer config.** Use the caller-supplied consumer `.pHive/hive.config.yaml` parse result. If it is `None` or absent, return `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated` and `runner_reason=consumer-config-missing`.
2. **Check executor value.** If `executor` is unset or empty, return `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated` and `runner_reason=executor-unset`. If `executor` is anything other than `hive-dag`, emit a structured warning and return `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated` with `runner_reason=unknown-executor`.
3. **Check default flag.** If `executor_default` is not truthy (`on`, `true`, `yes`, `1`, or YAML bool `True`), return `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated` and `runner_reason=executor-default-off`.
4. **Read graduation registry.** Use the caller-supplied graduation registry workflow list. If it is `None` or missing, treat it as an empty list: no workflows graduated, no warning emitted, return `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated` and `runner_reason=registry-missing-empty`.
5. **Per-workflow gate.** If `workflow_name` is not in the registry list, return `runner_path=orchestrator-narrated` and `runner_reason=workflow-not-graduated`. If it is present, return `runner_path=hive-dag` and `runner_reason=gates-pass`.

When `runner_path=hive-dag`, the caller invokes `hive.lib.dag_executor.run_workflow(workflow_path, dispatcher, run_state_path=..., worktree_manager=...)`. The caller must pass populated `run_state_path` and `worktree_manager` when L3 run-state persistence and worktree-per-run isolation are available; `worktree_manager=None` remains valid when the caller has already decided no isolation should be nested.

**Why this gating exists (Q4 lock):** the consumer-side flag layer keeps maintainer-only execution choices out of the shipped `hive/hive.config.yaml` (the eefbff3 / `project_config_shipping_deferred` pattern). The per-workflow registry layer lets graduation events ship without consumer config edits. Default OFF preserves zero-behaviour-change for non-opt-in consumers. Both gates must be true; either gate empty falls through to the orchestrator path.

**Missing-registry distinction:** a missing graduation registry is a normal fail-closed state and means no workflows are graduated. Do not warn for that case. Warn only when `executor` is set to an unknown non-empty value, for example `executor: hive-fast`.

## Single Dispatch Point

This skill is the single dispatch point for `/design` mode selection, the parallel-dispatch gate (Step 1.5, `ed-7`), and the executor-vs-orchestrator runner cutover for design workflows. Callers must consume `mode_decision`, `mode_reason`, `gate_violations[]`, `runner_path`, and `runner_reason` from this skill instead of re-implementing any of those decisions in another skill or workflow step.

When `mode_decision` resolves to `multica`, route to `skills/hive/skills/design-mode-multica/SKILL.md`. When `mode_decision` resolves to `cc-workflows`, route to `skills/hive/skills/design-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md`. Both atoms ship in later slices — references by skill-path here serve as forward declarations; their absence does not break this dispatch skill.

The parallel-dispatch gate is reachable from no other surface: any future skill that wants to fan design stories out concurrently MUST do so through this dispatch point so the gate inspects its `unblocked_stories[]` set, and MUST add a row to [`hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md`](../../../hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md) §2 for the new dispatch shape.
