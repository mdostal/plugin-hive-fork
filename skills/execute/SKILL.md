# Hive Execute

Execute stories through development workflow phases.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` contains epic ID and optional flags (`--methodology tdd|classic|bdd`, `--sequential`).

## State directory resolution

All state paths in this skill are written as `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/...`. Resolve `HIVE_STATE_DIR` from `paths.state_dir` in the ROOT `hive.config.yaml` (the consumer override layer). The shipped baseline at `hive/hive.config.yaml` is a fall-through source — it does NOT drive runtime path decisions per the Slice 1 resolver contract. The default is `.pHive`. When the root config sets a different value, substitute that value everywhere this skill writes `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}`, so relocation after marketplace install still works.

## Skill Preamble

See [`hive/references/skill-prelude.md`](../../hive/references/skill-prelude.md) — kickoff gate (initialization check) + persona / config / memory loading. The kickoff gate's `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/project-profile.yaml` reference resolves via the section above.

If the kickoff checks pass, proceed silently. Only surface kickoff-related output when a kickoff check fails and the selected gate behavior below requires a warning or stop.

## Delegation Rules (MANDATORY)

**The orchestrator is a coordinator, not an implementor.** The orchestrator MUST NOT:
- Write application code, tests, or configuration files directly
- Read source files to analyze or fix them
- Run tests, linters, or build commands
- Perform any work that belongs to a roster agent (developer, reviewer, tester, etc.)

**The orchestrator MUST delegate all implementation work using the correct tool:**

| Scope | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Parallelizing stories across the epic** | Natural-language team description or cmux panes | Stories run as named teammates described in the team prompt — one teammate per story — or in separate cmux panes when `execution.terminal_mux: cmux`. Parallel teammates are the default for eligible story sets; `execution.parallel_teams: false` or `--sequential` forces sequential execution. |
| **Sequential workflow steps within a single story** | `Agent` | Steps within a teammate's pane run inline — this is correct |
| **Specialist phase teams (pre-exec, post-exec)** | Natural-language team description | Specialist teams are independent coordination units — describe each as a named teammate in the team prompt |

Describe each story as a named teammate in the team prompt; the runtime materializes teammates automatically. Sequential execution remains available through `execution.parallel_teams: false` or `--sequential`.

## Process

1. **Load the epic.** Read `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/epic.yaml`. Behavior when this file is absent depends on `paths.gate_mode` (read from root `hive.config.yaml` consumer override layer; falls back to `hive/hive.config.yaml`; default `warning`; knob introduced by story `a-33-plan-gate-lift-and-gate-mode-knob`).

   **When `gate_mode: hard`:** the original behavior applies byte-equivalently — if the YAML is missing, stop and report the missing path. Do not proceed to step 2.

   **When `gate_mode: warning`:** synthesize an ad-hoc plan from `$ARGUMENTS` and proceed. The sequence is:

   1. Emit the warning below (verbatim):

      > Warning: `{epic-id}` not found at `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/epic.yaml`. Synthesizing ad-hoc plan from `$ARGUMENTS`. Run `/plan` first for a properly decomposed plan, or set `paths.gate_mode: hard` to restore blocking behavior.

   2. Resolve methodology via story `a-34-backend-auto-resolve` (already merged on this branch). Fall back to `classic` if auto-resolve cannot determine.

   3. Generate the ad-hoc YAML at `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/epic.yaml`. Create the parent `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/` and the `stories` subdirectory beneath it if absent. Template:

      ```yaml
      name: {epic-id}
      title: {one-line summary derived from $ARGUMENTS}
      methodology: {resolved by a-34 auto-resolve, fallback classic}
      ad_hoc: true
      created_by: /execute-gate-lift
      created_at: "<ISO 8601 timestamp>"
      stories:
        - id: {epic-id}-default
          title: {same as title above}
          depends_on: []
      ```

      The `ad_hoc: true` flag signals to downstream consumers (audit, /standup, /status) that this YAML was synthesized rather than planned. The single-story stub uses `{epic-id}-default` as its ID.

   4. Append one JSONL record to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/metrics/events/epic-create-on-fly-<ISO 8601 timestamp>.jsonl` with shape:

      ```json
      {"event":"epic_create_on_fly","skill":"execute","gate_mode":"warning","epic_id":"<epic-id>","source":"<$ARGUMENTS verbatim>","methodology":"<resolved>","timestamp":"<ISO 8601>"}
      ```

      Create `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/metrics/events/` if absent. This event feeds the audit introduced by story `a-36-post-run-audit-telemetry`.

   5. Inject the ad-hoc context into agent prompts downstream: include "This is an ad-hoc run — the YAML was synthesized from `$ARGUMENTS` without prior planning. Escalate to the orchestrator if scope is unclear or acceptance criteria are unspecified." in the system context of every spawned agent. This prevents agents from over-broadly interpreting the one-line story stub.

   6. Proceed to step 2 (cycle state) as normal.

1b. **Reconciliation gate (auto-firing, story `wr-6-plan-drift-instrument`).** Read the loaded epic's `depends_on_epic:` and `planned_base_ref:` fields (`hive/references/story-yaml-schema.md` § 6.5). This gate REQUIRES a reconciliation artifact when the epic's dependency has moved since planning — it does not hard-block; it is a warn-then-require, same posture as the wr-1 completion-record detector.

   Compute the gate decision by invoking `hive.lib.plan_drift.check_reconciliation_required(epic_dict, cwd=<repo root>)` (Python — charter C1: marker/validator logic lives in Python, not inline shell). This returns a dict with `required: bool` and `reason:` one of `not-tracked`, `legacy-non-sha-placeholder`, `cannot-resolve`, `base-unchanged`, `base-moved`.

   - **`required: false`** (any of `not-tracked` / `legacy-non-sha-placeholder` / `cannot-resolve` / `base-unchanged`): proceed silently to step 2. `cannot-resolve` fails open — a broken git state must never block execute — but emit `[warn] step 1b: plan-drift check could not resolve current ref — skipping gate` so the failure-open path is visible in logs, not silent.
   - **`required: true`** (`base-moved`): before proceeding to story 1 (i.e. before step 4's topological sort begins any story), require `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/reconciliation.md` to exist (template: `hive/references/reconciliation-artifact-template.md`).
     - If it already exists (a prior run reconciled this exact `planned_base_ref` -> `current_base_ref` transition), read its `## Deltas` section and proceed — do not re-require.
     - If it does not exist, emit:
       ```
       [warn] step 1b: {epic-id} depends_on_epic={depends_on_epic} — base moved since planning (planned_base_ref={planned_base_ref}, current={current_base_ref}). Reconciliation artifact required before story 1.
       ```
       and produce the artifact: for each delta the dependency's actual delivery introduces versus what `/plan` assumed, record `{planned, actual, stories_touched}` per the template. Zero deltas is valid — write the artifact with an empty `## Deltas` list rather than skip it, so the gate has evidence reconciliation ran.
     - Once the artifact exists (freshly written or pre-existing), count its `## Deltas` entries and call `hive.lib.plan_drift.emit_plan_drift(run_id, epic_id, delta_count)` to record the plan-drift metric (`hive/references/metrics-event.schema.md` — `plan_drift_delta_count`), then proceed to step 2.

2. **Load or create cycle state.** Check `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/cycle-state/{epic-id}.yaml`. If it doesn't exist, create a minimal one with `epic_id` and `created` timestamp. The cycle state accumulates decisions across phases — see `hive/references/cycle-state-schema.md`. Include the cycle state in all downstream agent prompts as system-level constraints.

2b. **Read and partition escalations.** Inspect the `escalations:` field of the loaded cycle state.

   **If `escalations:` is absent or empty:** emit a single debug trace:
   ```
   [debug] step 2b: no escalations in cycle state
   ```
   Proceed directly to step 3. Make no other changes — do not create directories, do not write files, do not modify cycle state.

   **If `escalations:` is present and non-empty:**

   First, load the specialist-triggers catalog by reading `hive/references/specialist-triggers.md`. This catalog is needed for trigger lookups (responds_with, workflow fields) in the steps below.

   - For each record, validate the `trigger` ID against the catalog loaded above. The catalog is the authoritative set of valid trigger IDs.
     - If the record's `trigger` ID does not match any entry in the catalog: log a warning `[warn] step 2b: unknown trigger "{trigger}" — skipping record` and skip that record. Do not crash, do not fall through to catalog-derived lookups (`responds_with.id`, `workflow`, `skill`) — an unknown trigger has no catalog entry to read.
   - For each record, validate the `placement` field against the enum `{pre-exec, post-exec, append}`.
     - If `placement` has an unknown value: log a warning `[warn] step 2b: unknown placement value "{value}" — skipping record` and skip that record. Do not crash.
     - If any other required field (`trigger`, `severity`, `stories`, `reason`, `raised_by`, `raised_at`) is missing or null: log a warning `[warn] step 2b: escalation record missing required field "{field}" — skipping record` and skip that record.
   - Partition valid records into three in-memory lists:
     - `pre_exec[]` — records with `placement: pre-exec`
     - `post_exec[]` — records with `placement: post-exec`
     - `appends[]` — records with `placement: append`
   - For `appends[]`: build a story→sidecar_agents map: `{story_id: [agent_name, ...]}` from each record's `stories` list and the target agent(s) from the trigger's catalog `responds_with.id`. Only use `stories` entries that match a canonical story ID in the current epic (i.e., a corresponding story YAML exists at `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/stories/{id}.yaml`). Log a warning for any non-canonical entry: `[warn] step 2b: stories[] entry "{entry}" is not a canonical story ID — skipping for sidecar map`.
   - For any trigger whose catalog entry has both `workflow:` empty and `skill:` empty: emit a trace `[debug] step 2b: trigger {trigger_id} — specialist phase not yet implemented, skipping`. This is a graceful no-op — do not halt execution.
   - Emit a single summary trace:
     ```
     [info] step 2b: escalation partition: {N} pre-exec, {M} post-exec, {P} appends
     ```

   **Critical constraints for this step:**
   - Pure read — must not modify cycle state, must not create directories, must not write files.
   - `pre_exec[]`, `post_exec[]`, and `appends[]` are built in memory but not yet consumed. Downstream stories add consumption logic.
   - If a trigger's `responds_with.id` does not resolve to an existing agent file (`hive/agents/{id}.md`) or team config (`${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/teams/{id}.yaml`): log `[warn] step 2b: responds_with.id "{id}" — referenced agent/team file not found on disk — continuing` and continue.

2c. **xhigh-effort audit escalation.** Read `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/session-effort.txt` (see `hive/references/configuration.md` — Effort & Context Adaptation). This file holds one of `low | medium | high | xhigh`, written by `hooks/effort-gate.sh`.

   - **Effort == `xhigh`:** if `pre_exec[]` does not already contain a record for trigger `security:plan-audit` (i.e. it was not already raised by a real escalation in step 2b), synthesize one in memory — `{trigger: security:plan-audit, placement: pre-exec, severity: xhigh-forced, stories: [], reason: "xhigh effort escalation", raised_by: effort-gate, raised_at: now}` — and append it to `pre_exec[]`. This reuses the existing `security:plan-audit` catalog entry (`hive/references/specialist-triggers.md`) and its bound `hive/workflows/security-audit.workflow.yaml` runner — no bespoke audit runner is introduced. Emit:
     ```
     [info] step 2c: effort=xhigh — forcing security:plan-audit into pre-exec specialist phase loop
     ```
   - **Effort == `medium` / `high` / `low`, or the file is absent/unreadable:** this gate is a no-op — `pre_exec[]` passes through unchanged from step 2b. Never force audits below `xhigh`.

3. **Load the workflow definition.** Based on the `--methodology` parameter (default: `classic`), load:
   ```
   hive/workflows/development.{methodology}.workflow.yaml
   ```
   If the file does not exist, report an error listing available methodologies (files matching `hive/workflows/development.*.workflow.yaml`). See `hive/references/methodology-routing.md` for how methodologies control phase ordering.

4. **Topologically sort stories** by their `depends_on` fields.

4a. **Pre-exec phase loop.** If `pre_exec[]` is empty, skip this step entirely — zero behavior change for escalation-free epics.

   > **Parallel-call-site annotation (audit pass):** `parallel_rationale: bounded-slice` — each specialist team writes to a declared phase-output directory at `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/specialist-phases/{trigger}/{epic-id}/`. The loop iterates triggers sequentially (one `Agent(name:)` call per trigger), so this is *not* story-level fan-out and is out-of-scope for the `ed-7` parallel gate; catalogued in [`hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md`](../../hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md) §3 (`execute:specialist-phases`). The annotation also applies to the symmetric post-exec loop in step 7a below.

   For each trigger in `pre_exec[]`, ordered by `raised_at` ASC (severity DESC as tiebreak), look up the trigger's catalog entry in `hive/references/specialist-triggers.md` (loaded in step 2b) to resolve `responds_with.id` and `workflow` fields. Then apply the three-condition branch:

   **Prerequisite — team_memory_path validation:** Before spawning, verify the team config's `team_memory_path` directory exists on disk. If it does not, emit an actionable error — e.g., `[error] pre-exec: team_memory_path "${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/team-memories/security-team/" does not exist — create it before running specialist phases` — skip the trigger, and continue. Do not crash execute.

   **(i) workflow field set AND workflow file exists on disk:**
   Invoke `Agent(name:)` with the team config and workflow fields from the trigger's catalog entry. Write phase output to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/specialist-phases/{trigger}/{epic-id}/` (where `{trigger}` is the trigger ID string, e.g., `security:plan-audit`). If the `Agent(name:)` call errors: log the failure (e.g., `[error] pre-exec: Agent(name:) failed for {trigger-id} — {error}`), write a failure marker to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/specialist-phases/{trigger}/{epic-id}/failure.md`, and continue to the next trigger. Do not crash execute.

   **(ii) workflow field set AND workflow file MISSING from disk:**
   Log `[info] pre-exec: specialist workflow not yet built — skipping {trigger-id}` → no-op. Continue to next trigger.

   **(iii) workflow field empty:**
   Log `[info] pre-exec: specialist phase {trigger-id} not yet implemented — skipping` → no-op. Continue to next trigger.

   Cases (ii) and (iii) use DISTINCT log messages — do NOT collapse them. Both are valid no-ops; distinct messages are the operational basis for case triage.

   > **v1 note:** v1 routing handles `workflow`-based catalog entries only. A catalog entry with `skill: <path>` (allowed by catalog schema but unused in v1) is not reached by condition (i) and falls to condition (ii) or (iii). Skill-based routing is a Phase 6 extension point.

5. **Choose execution mode.** Invoke `skills/hive/skills/execute-dispatch/SKILL.md` with env, parsed root `hive.config.yaml`, parsed consumer `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/hive.config.yaml`, parsed graduation registry, `workflow_name`, `$ARGUMENTS`, and `unblocked_stories[]` — the depth-0 ready stories from the topological sort in step 4. Each story payload includes `id`, `parallel_allowed`, `parallel_rationale`, and (for `bounded-slice` rationale) `files_to_modify[]`. Consume `mode_decision`, `mode_reason`, `gate_violations[]`, `runner_path`, and `runner_reason`.

   When `gate_violations[]` is non-empty, the dispatch has been downgraded to `sequential` by the parallel-dispatch gate (`ed-7`). Surface the warning to stdout naming every offending story ID and the reason recorded by the gate (the structured format is documented in `execute-dispatch/SKILL.md` Step 1.5). Do not re-implement the gate logic here — the dispatch skill is the single boundary for this decision per the parallel-call-sites registry (`hive/references/parallel-call-sites.md`).

   Switch `mode_decision`: `sessions` -> step 6c, `team-cmux` -> step 6b, `team` -> step 6, `sequential` -> step 7, `sandcastle` -> step 6d, `multica` -> step 5e, `cc-workflows` -> step 6f.
5pre. **Executor cutover routing.** Use only the returned `runner_path` and `runner_reason`; do not re-evaluate the cutover tree here. If `runner_path == hive-dag`, call `hive.lib.dag_executor.run_workflow(workflow_path, dispatcher, run_state_path=..., worktree_manager=...)`; otherwise continue on the orchestrator-narrated path. Single dispatch point: this skill call is the only `/execute` policy boundary for executor-vs-orchestrator routing.

5e. **DAG/Multica front-door dispatch.** Reached when `mode_decision == multica`. Route each story through the DAG run entrypoint with the Multica binding. This is the symmetric sibling of the planning-routing DAG front-door path (s9).

**Methodology→graph selection.** Map the resolved `methodology` (from `--methodology`, default `classic`) to the development graph:

- `classic` → `hive/workflows/development.classic.workflow.yaml`
- `tdd` → `hive/workflows/development.tdd.workflow.yaml`
- `bdd` → `hive/workflows/development.bdd.workflow.yaml`

If the target graph file does not exist, report an error and list available graphs (files matching `hive/workflows/development.*.workflow.yaml`).

**DAG front-door invocation.** For each story in `unblocked_stories[]`:

```python
from hive.lib.dag_executor.run import run, resolve_spawn_binding

result = run(
    workflow_path,        # resolved methodology graph above
    binding=resolve_spawn_binding(flow="execution")[0],
    context={
        "epic_id": epic_id,
        "story_id": story.id,
        "methodology": methodology,
    },
)
```

Emit one INFO log line at dispatch:

```
[info] execute routing: story={story_id} methodology={methodology} graph={workflow_path} binding=multica reason=dag-multica
```

Graph completion is an **artifact-readiness signal only** — not a per-story done signal. Per-story completion tracking (episode markers, `completed`/`failed` sets) remains the orchestrator's responsibility per the episode-schema contract.

Completion here is a convention, not a gate: no tool boundary lets a hook intercept the orchestrator writing a story's files, so `/execute` cannot structurally refuse an incomplete completion. The standard record it converges on (episode markers per step, OR a schema-conformant cycle-state persona_dispatch+verdict block) is a **documented expectation**, not an enforced one. `hive/lib/completion_record_detector.py`, wired to SubagentStop/Stop via `hooks/completion-record-detect.sh`, is the DETECTOR half of that contract: it inspects the current epic/story post-hoc and WARNS loudly when the standard record is missing or malformed — including when an epic has no cycle-state file at all. It never blocks.

**Depth advancement.** Collect story results and proceed to step 6g (depth-advancement loop) with `completed`/`failed` sets populated from `result`.

**Fallback.** If the Multica binding fails:

- Daemon down (ECONNREFUSED, timeout during `binding=multica` init): emit `[warn] execute routing: dag-multica daemon down for story={story_id} — falling back to local` and route that story through step 7 (sequential) with the local executor.
- Dispatch error (graph-step error, node timeout): emit `[warn] execute routing: dag-multica dispatch failed for story={story_id}: {error} — falling back to local` and apply the same local fallback.

**Local fallback (backend unset).** When `mode_decision != multica`, this step is skipped entirely. Existing paths (sessions → 6c, team-cmux → 6b, team → 6, sequential → 7, sandcastle → 6d, cc-workflows → 6f) are unchanged — no regression.

6. **Agent team execution.** Follow **`references/team-execution.md`** for the full `Agent(name:)` prompt template, per-story commit pattern, sidecar injection for append-placement triggers, and respawn monitoring.

6b. **Agent team execution (cmux path).** Use this path when all four step-5 conditions are true and `execution.terminal_mux` resolves to `cmux`.
   Invoke `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-team-cmux/SKILL.md` with:
   - `workflow_path`: the workflow loaded in step 3
   - `unblocked_stories[]`: the depth-0 ready stories from the topological sort
   - `appends_map`: the review-phase sidecar map from step 2b
   - `epic_handle`: the current epic identifier
   See `references/team-execution.md` for cmux-variant `Agent(name:)` prompt details.

6c. **Session-based execution** (used when `HIVE_SESSIONS_ENABLED` or `sessions.enabled: true`). Replaces the `Agent(name:)` path with the Claude Agent SDK `/v1/sessions` API for story-level execution.
   Invoke `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-session/SKILL.md` with:
   - `workflow_path`: the workflow loaded in step 3
   - `unblocked_stories[]`: the depth-0 ready stories from the topological sort
   - `appends_map`: the review-phase sidecar map from step 2b
   - `epic_handle`: the current epic identifier
   - `hive_config`: parsed root `hive.config.yaml` (for `sessions.*` and `model_tiers`)

6d. **Sandcastle execution** (used when `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE=sandcastle` or root config `execution.mode: sandcastle`). Routes each story into an isolated sandcastle container via the Codex auth-mounted provider.
   Invoke `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-sandcastle/SKILL.md` with:
   - `workflow_path`: the workflow loaded in step 3
   - `unblocked_stories[]`: the depth-0 ready stories from the topological sort
   - `appends_map`: the review-phase sidecar map from step 2b
   - `epic_handle`: the current epic identifier
   - `hive_config`: parsed root `hive.config.yaml` (for `execution.sandcastle.*` options)

6e. **Multica execution** (used when `HIVE_EXECUTION_MODE=multica` or root config `execution.mode: multica`). Routes each story into a Multica issue assigned to the bootstrapped `developer` agent; Multica owns the inner task work_dir and execution after assignment.
   Invoke `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-multica/SKILL.md` with:
   - `workflow_path`: the workflow loaded in step 3
   - `unblocked_stories[]`: the depth-0 ready stories from the topological sort
   - `appends_map`: the review-phase sidecar map from step 2b
   - `epic_handle`: the current epic identifier
   - `hive_config`: parsed root `hive.config.yaml` (for `execution.multica.*` options and `agent_backends.*`)

6f. **CC Workflows execution** (used when `HIVE_EXECUTION_RUNTIME=workflows` or root config `execution.runtime: cc-workflows`). Routes each story into a Workflow tool dispatch.
   Invoke `skills/hive/skills/execute-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md` with:
   - `workflow_path`: the workflow loaded in step 3
   - `unblocked_stories[]`: the depth-0 ready stories from the topological sort
   - `appends_map`: the review-phase sidecar map from step 2b
   - `epic_handle`: the current epic identifier
   - `hive_config`: parsed root `hive.config.yaml` (for `execution.cc-workflows.*` options)

   Step 6f does not recursively spawn /workflows from within a dispatched agent — the Workflow tool runs once per dispatched story. `/execute` owns depth advancement and re-invokes this skill for each subsequent DAG depth per step 6g below.

6g. **Depth-advancement loop (generic across modes).** After the chosen mode skill (6b/6c/6d/6e/6f) returns its depth summary, integrate per-story results into the run's `completed` and `failed` sets, then re-walk the topological sort from step 4:

   ```text
   next_unblocked = stories
     - completed
     - failed
     - in-flight
     filtered by: every dep ∈ completed
   ```

   - If `next_unblocked` is non-empty, re-invoke the SAME mode skill at the same step (6b/6c/6d/6e/6f) with `unblocked_stories[] = next_unblocked` and the rest of the invocation contract unchanged. Each re-invocation is one DAG depth.
   - If `next_unblocked` is empty AND `in-flight` is empty AND `failed` is non-empty, halt with a partial-epic verdict; surface the failed story IDs and unreachable downstream stories to the user.
   - If `next_unblocked` is empty AND `in-flight` is empty AND every story is in `completed`, proceed to step 7 (post-exec) and step 8 (summary + audit).

   This loop is the contract every depth-0-only mode skill (`execute-mode-multica`, `execute-mode-cc-workflows`, `execute-mode-sandcastle`) relies on. Per their constraint summaries they explicitly delegate depth advancement to `/execute`; this step is that delegation.

6h. **Branch + worktree + PR convention.** Apply for every dispatch mode unless the mode skill states otherwise:

   - **Branch per epic** — integration branch is `feat/<epic-id>` (override via `epic.git_flow.branch`). Verify before step 6{x}; create from `epic.git_flow.base_branch` (default `develop`) if absent.
   - **Commit per story** — enforced by the per-mode serial-commit gate (see `execute-mode-cc-workflows/SKILL.md` Step 3 and `references/team-execution.md` per-story commit pattern). One `git commit` per terminal-passed story; commit subject prefix `[<story-id>]`.
   - **Worktree per epic (recommended)** — when `cc-workflows` mode is selected, isolate the whole `/execute` run to a dedicated worktree at `.claude/worktrees/<epic-id>/` per `feedback_cc_workflows_worktree_required.md`. The worktree is created once at step 6 entry and removed at step 8 close (operator choice via `ExitWorktree`).
   - **PR per epic** — opened at step 8 close, after every story is `completed`. One PR per `feat/<epic-id>` against `epic.git_flow.base_branch`. Do NOT open per-story PRs.

7. **Sequential execution.** Follow **`references/sequential-execution.md`** for the step-by-step workflow within each story, sidecar injection at the review step, episode records, gate checks, and respawn monitoring.

7a. **Post-exec phase loop.** If `post_exec[]` is empty, skip this step entirely — zero behavior change for escalation-free epics.

   For each trigger in `post_exec[]`, ordered by `raised_at` ASC (severity DESC as tiebreak), apply the three-condition branch:

   **Prerequisite — team_memory_path validation:** Before spawning, verify the team config's `team_memory_path` directory exists on disk. If it does not, emit an actionable error — e.g., `[error] post-exec: team_memory_path "${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/team-memories/security-team/" does not exist — create it before running specialist phases` — skip the trigger, and continue. Do not crash execute.

   **(i) workflow field set AND workflow file exists on disk:**
   Invoke `Agent(name:)` with the team config and workflow fields from the trigger's catalog entry. Write phase output to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/specialist-phases/{trigger}/{epic-id}/`. If the `Agent(name:)` call errors: log the failure (e.g., `[error] post-exec: Agent(name:) failed for {trigger-id} — {error}`), write a failure marker to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/specialist-phases/{trigger}/{epic-id}/failure.md`, and continue to the next trigger. Do not crash execute.

   **(ii) workflow field set AND workflow file MISSING from disk:**
   Log `[info] post-exec: specialist workflow not yet built — skipping {trigger-id}` → no-op. Continue to next trigger.

   **(iii) workflow field empty:**
   Log `[info] post-exec: specialist phase {trigger-id} not yet implemented — skipping` → no-op. Continue to next trigger.

   Cases (ii) and (iii) use DISTINCT log messages — do NOT collapse them. Both are valid no-ops; distinct messages are the operational basis for case triage.

   > **v1 note:** v1 routing handles `workflow`-based catalog entries only. A catalog entry with `skill: <path>` (allowed by catalog schema but unused in v1) is not reached by condition (i) and falls to condition (ii) or (iii). Skill-based routing is a Phase 6 extension point.

7c. **Terminal handoff dispatch.** After the `integrate` workflow step completes for a story, dispatch any configured post-integrate handoff.

   > **Multica issue close.** When `task_tracking.adapter` is `multica`, the closer (`hive/lib/multica-issue-closer.mjs`) is invoked here to transition the story's Multica issue to `done`. See [multica-issue-closer-runbook.md](../../hive/references/multica-issue-closer-runbook.md) for failure modes, WARN escalation thresholds, and the manual sweep procedure.

   **Gate check — integrate episode marker required.** Before reading `terminal_handoff`, verify the integrate episode marker exists at `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/episodes/{epic-id}/{story-id}/integrate.yaml`. If the marker is absent (integrate failed or was skipped):

   ```
   [warn] handoff: integrate episode marker missing for {story-id} — skipping handoff
   ```

   Write a `handoff_log` row to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/cycle-state/{epic-id}.yaml` with `skipped_reason: "no-integrate-episode"` and continue to the next story. Do not invoke `/test` or `/review`.

   **Resolve target.** Read `story.terminal_handoff.next` from the story YAML. If the field is absent or null, fall back to `epic.execution.terminal_handoff_default` from the loaded epic YAML, then to the `execution.terminal_handoff_default` knob in the root `hive.config.yaml`. If all are absent, treat as `none`.

   **Dispatch.** When target is not `none`:

   ```javascript
   import { dispatchHandoff } from 'hive/lib/handoff/dispatch.mjs';

   const result = await dispatchHandoff({
     story_id: story.id,
     target,           // 'test' | 'review' | 'both'
     branch,           // current story branch
     pr_number,        // undefined when no PR exists
     // Do NOT pass timeout_ms here — let dispatchHandoff resolve it from
     // execution.terminal_handoff.timeout_seconds in hive.config.yaml.
     // circuit_breakers.story_timeout_minutes is the orchestrator's outer
     // circuit, not the handoff timeout.
     state_dir: HIVE_STATE_DIR,
   });
   ```

   - `target: 'test'` — invokes `/test --story <story-id>` (or scenario path when a simulated-manual concern is on the story; read `story.test_scenario` if present and pass its path instead).
   - `target: 'review'` — invokes `/review #<pr_number>` when `pr_number` is set, else `/review <branch>`.
   - `target: 'both'` — runs test first, then review with the test verdict available to the reviewer.
   - `target: 'none'` — no-op; skip the log write entirely.

   **Timeout handling.** When `result.ok === false && result.reason === 'timeout'`, log a warning and continue to the next story — a timeout must not block the rest of the epic:

   ```
   [warn] handoff: story={story_id} target={target} timed out after {duration_ms}ms — continuing to next story
   ```

   `dispatch.mjs` already emits a `phase_handoff_timeout` JSONL event and a `phase_handoff:<target>:timeout` KG triple at the moment of timeout; the executor only needs to write the log row and continue.

   **handoff_log writeback.** Regardless of verdict (even on `ok: false`), append one row to `handoff_log[]` in `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/cycle-state/{epic-id}.yaml`. Include `timeout_at` when the row is a timeout:

   ```yaml
   handoff_log:
     - story_id: <story_id>
       target: <target>
       started_at: "<ISO 8601>"
       finished_at: "<ISO 8601>"
       verdict: <result.verdict or (result.reason === 'timeout' ? 'timeout' : 'error')>
       evidence_ref: <result.evidence_ref or "">
       duration_ms: <result.duration_ms or 0>
       # timeout_at present only when verdict=timeout:
       timeout_at: <result.timeout_at>   # omit field entirely when verdict ≠ timeout
   ```

   If the cycle state file does not yet have a `handoff_log:` key, create the list. Emit a debug trace after write:

   ```
   [debug] handoff: story={story_id} target={target} verdict={verdict} duration={duration_ms}ms
   ```

7b. **Project dispatch status.** After a story is successfully dispatched or claimed for work by the selected execution mode, write `/execute`'s owned lifecycle transition from [`status-lifecycle.md`](../../hive/references/status-lifecycle.md): update that story YAML's `status:` projection from `pending` to `in_progress`.

    This write is gated on dispatch success. Do not write `in_progress` before the story is actually handed to a teammate/session/sandcastle/Multica/CC Workflows runner, and do not write it when dispatch fails, is skipped, or is blocked by dependency gating. `/execute` does not own `in_review`, `complete`, or `shipped`; terminal workflow completion and integrate success must not be projected as story `complete`.

    When `task_tracking.adapter` is configured, mirror only this owned `in_progress` transition to the task tracker via the dispatch module. This is a no-op when `task_tracking.adapter` is unset.

    Only stories with a populated `tracker_id` (written by `plan` Phase D) are eligible. The dispatch module owns gate_mode behavior, telemetry, and error mapping — do not branch on the adapter vendor here.

    ```typescript
    import { TaskTrackingDispatch } from "hive/lib/task-tracking-dispatch/index.ts";

    const dispatch = new TaskTrackingDispatch();
    await dispatch.load(config.task_tracking);

    if (!story.tracker_id) return; // no tracker record to update

    const result = await dispatch.invoke(
      "updateStatus",
      { id: story.tracker_id, state: newState },
      { skill_context: "execute" },
    );

    if (!result.ok && result.code !== "NO_ADAPTER" && !result.recoverable) {
      // Terminal error: dispatch wrote a prose-runbook-fallback telemetry
      // event under gate_mode=warning. Surface to the user; execution can
      // proceed without the tracker update — local episode markers remain
      // the source of truth for story state per the episode-schema.
    }
    ```

    Episode markers (per `hive/references/episode-schema.md`) are still authoritative for in-Hive state. Tracker status updates are a one-way projection — failures here never block the workflow.

7d. **Multica story close (integrate hook).** Immediately after the `integrate` step's commit+push completes, the integrate step file calls `closeStoryIssue({epic_id, story_id})` from `hive/lib/multica-issue-closer.mjs`. This hook is gated on `task_tracking.adapter === 'multica'` (read from root `hive.config.yaml`); other values (including null / unset) skip with a one-line `[gate_mode]` log. The hook is also skipped for dry-run invocations and when /execute is in `--simulated-manual` mode. On any `ok: false` result, one warn line is emitted and /execute continues — this hook never blocks story completion. The full gate logic and log-line templates live in the integrate step file (`hive/workflows/steps/development-classic/step-08-integrate.md` §6a).

7e. **Epic finalize — version bump and changelog.** After the last story's integrate step has completed successfully, and before the final run summary, read `version_bump` from the loaded `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/epics/{epic-id}/epic.yaml`.

   - If `version_bump` is absent, treat it as `none` and emit:

     ```
     [info] finalize: epic.yaml has no version_bump; treating as none
     ```

   - If `version_bump: none`, perform a clean no-op: do not edit any version source, do not add a changelog release entry, do not create a finalize commit. Continue to step 8.

   - If `version_bump` is one of `major`, `minor`, or `patch`, compute the next SemVer from the current lockstep version. Version sources are:
     - every JSON file matching `.claude-plugin/*.json`;
     - `plugin.json` at the repository root when present.

     Parse each JSON file with a structured JSON parser. Collect every `version` field recursively (for example `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has both a root `version` and nested plugin metadata). All discovered values MUST be identical before bumping. If they differ, stop finalize and report the mismatched path/key/value set; do not partially edit files.

   - Apply the computed new version to every discovered `version` field in those sources, preserving JSON formatting conventions already present in the file.

   - Write a changelog entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for this epic. The entry MUST name the epic ID, the bump level, and the old/new version pair, for example:

     ```markdown
     ### Changed

     - **`{epic-id}` release finalization.** `/execute` applied the planned `{version_bump}` version bump (`{old_version}` → `{new_version}`) and kept plugin version sources in lockstep.
     ```

     If `## [Unreleased]` already contains the appropriate category heading, append under it instead of duplicating the heading.

     This entry is version accounting only — the human-readable prose entry for the release is authored in `/ship` (see `skills/ship/SKILL.md` step 3 and `hive/references/changelog-entry-format.md`).

   - Commit the version-source and changelog changes together in one finalize commit. Stage only the targets that exist — a literal `git add` of a missing path or an unmatched glob errors out — so build the add-list from the version sources actually present plus `CHANGELOG.md` when present:

     ```bash
     # Collect only existing targets (globs that match nothing are dropped).
     targets=()
     for f in .claude-plugin/*.json plugin.json CHANGELOG.md; do
       [ -e "$f" ] && targets+=("$f")
     done
     if [ ${#targets[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
       git add "${targets[@]}"
     fi
     git commit -m "chore(release): bump plugin version for {epic-id}"
     ```

     If there are no diffs after applying the bump and changelog entry (nothing staged), report `[info] finalize: version bump already applied for {epic-id}` and do not commit.

8. After step 6g exits with `next_unblocked` empty AND `in-flight` empty, produce summary + audit + PR:

   0. **Epic PR.** If `task_tracking.adapter` does not own PR creation AND `failed` is empty (full-pass run), open one PR per the branch + worktree + PR convention (step 6h) — but first check whether a dispatched background agent already opened one.

      **Adopt-if-exists check (bg Auto-PR).** A story dispatched via `--bg`/`--background` (Multica or sessions binding) may have already opened its own draft PR under its own account and be auto-fixing CI on it. Hive must not create a second PR for the same branch. Before creating, query for an existing open PR on the epic's head branch:

      ```sh
      existing_pr=$(gh pr list \
        --head "${epic.git_flow.branch:-feat/<epic-id>}" \
        --state open \
        --json url,number,isDraft \
        --jq '.[0]')
      ```

      - **If `existing_pr` is non-empty:** skip creation — do not run `gh pr create`. Adopt the found PR's `url`/`number` as this epic's PR record (this is what step 8's story tracker/PR linkage points at). Log `[info] finalize: existing PR #<number> (draft=<isDraft>) found on <branch> — adopting, skipping Hive PR creation`.
      - **If `existing_pr` is empty:** create as before:

        ```sh
        gh pr create \
          --base ${epic.git_flow.base_branch:-develop} \
          --head ${epic.git_flow.branch:-feat/<epic-id>} \
          --title "feat(<epic-id>): <epic.title>" \
          --body "Closes epic <epic-id>. Stories: <comma-list of completed story-ids>."
        ```

        **Race guard — idempotent on create-conflict.** A bg agent can open its PR in the window between the check above and this create call. If `gh pr create` fails with a "already exists" error (`GraphQL: A pull request already exists for <owner>:<branch>`), do not treat this as a run failure — re-run the `gh pr list` query above and adopt the now-existing PR instead, using the same log line as the adopt branch.

      Capture the returned or adopted PR URL in the run summary. If `failed` is non-empty (partial-epic), skip PR open/adopt and surface unreachable downstream stories per step 6g's partial-epic verdict.

   1. **Run summary** — existing behavior: list completed stories, any failed/blocked, and final status. Include PR URL when step 8.0 opened or adopted one.

   2. **Post-run audit** — scan this run's resolved state per `hive/references/gate-lift-telemetry.md`:
      - `gate_lift_fired` (true if step 1 took the warning branch and synthesized an ad-hoc plan)
      - `backend_resolution` sources (collected from the `execute-dispatch` sub-skill invoked at step 5 per a-34 Sane Default Resolution; map of `sessions_enabled`, `parallel_teams`, `terminal_mux`, `executor` → `flag|env|hive-config|default`)
      - methodology (resolved value + source)
      - work artifacts (commits made, files modified during the run)

   3. Evaluate nonsensical-default heuristics from the reference doc:
      - **Lifted gate + no work**: `gate_lift_fired` was true AND the run produced zero commits + zero file modifications.
      - **All backend defaults**: every `backend_resolution` field resolved from `default` (user has not configured anything).
      - **TDD without tests**: resolved methodology is `tdd` AND no test files were touched during the run.

   4. If ANY heuristic fires, emit ONE consolidated warning to stdout listing every triggered field plus its override path. Use the same shape documented in `skills/plan/SKILL.md` step 20 (warning header + per-field bullets + final override line pointing at `paths.gate_mode: hard`).

   5. Always write the audit record to `${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/audits/post-run/<run-id>.yaml` (create the directory if absent). Same schema as `skills/plan/SKILL.md` step 20, with two differences:
      - `skill: execute`
      - additional field `backend_sources` mapping `sessions_enabled`, `parallel_teams`, `terminal_mux`, `executor` to their resolved source.

   6. Silent on healthy runs (no stdout warning when zero heuristics fire) — YAML record still written with empty `nonsensical_defaults: []` for cross-run aggregation by `hive/scripts/gate-mode-audit.mjs`.

## Scope-drift emit (per-story boundary)

Emit a single `scope_drift_score` event when a story completes (after
the final workflow phase writes its episode marker, before /execute
moves to the next story). Earlier per-phase emits — one per
research/implement/test/review/integrate boundary — produce ~3× the
event volume with almost no additional signal, because what matters
for downstream consumers is whether the **story** delivered its
acceptance criteria, not which intra-story phase shifted the scope.

The emit runs whether the story was executed by a `Agent` step
(sequential), a teammate pane (team), a session, or a sandcastle:

```bash
python3 -c "
from hive.lib.scope_drift import emit_scope_drift
emit_scope_drift(
    run_id='{run-id}',                   # this /execute run
    phase_label='execute:story',
    expected_scope={list from the story's acceptance criteria + planned files},
    delivered_scope={list of items actually delivered when the story closed},
    delta_reasons={enum values from cycle-state-schema.md when they differ},
    story_id='{story-id}',
    skill='execute',
)
"
```

`expected_scope` / `delivered_scope` / `delta_reasons` are sourced from
the story's aggregated `phase_records[]` entries on the cycle state at
`${HIVE_STATE_DIR}/cycle-state/{epic-id}.yaml`
([cycle-state-schema](../../hive/references/cycle-state-schema.md) §
Phase records) — collapse the per-phase lists into the story-level
expected vs delivered sets. When the story exits cleanly with no
drift, `expected_scope == delivered_scope` and `delta_reasons == []` —
the helper buckets that to `none` (ordinal 0), which is the desired
healthy default.

The maturity gate from story `ed-1-maturity-helper` skips emit on
greenfield/early projects and logs once per run. No new error handling
— treat the call as fire-and-forget.

### Per-step token budgets (advisory caps)

When `hive.config.yaml → circuit_breakers` defines `max_tokens_per_step`, `max_tokens_per_fix_loop`, or `max_tokens_per_story`, treat them as **advisory caps** during execution:

- Track token usage per step via the existing token-capture substrate.
- When a step's cumulative tokens approach the advisory cap (≥80%), emit a structured warning to the orchestrator. Do NOT hard-block on the cap.
- When a step crosses the cap, log it as a budget_exceeded telemetry event and continue. The cap is a tuning signal for future planning, not a runtime stop.
- **Fail-open semantics.** If token data is missing for any reason (capture not enabled, persona doesn't emit usage, etc.), proceed without warnings — never fail the step on missing telemetry. The advisory cap requires data to apply; absence is silent skip, not error.

This is intentionally softer than the existing iteration-count breakers (`max_step_retries`, `max_fix_iterations`, etc.) — those gate runtime behavior; token caps tune empirical defaults via telemetry.
