/**
 * .github/scripts/sandcastle-hive-bridge.mts
 *
 * Bridge between the GitHub Actions workflow and the upstream
 * `@ai-hero/sandcastle` programmatic API. Invoked by
 * `.github/workflows/hive-dispatch.yml` after a maintainer labels an
 * issue `hive:ready`.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   1. Validate ISSUE_NUMBER + the API key env are present (clear error
 *      on absence — never silent).
 *   2. Resolve the branch name: when the issue carries a
 *      `hive:epic:<epic-id>` label AND the repo's resolved
 *      `branch_strategy` (resolved by the workflow's Python helper) is
 *      `per-epic`,
 *      use `feat/<epic-id>`; otherwise fall back to `agent/issue-<n>`.
 *   3. Build a prompt that delegates to `/hive:execute` against the
 *      labeled issue.
 *   4. Invoke `sandcastle.run({ ... })` with the resolved branch.
 *   5. Emit a structured result line for the workflow to capture.
 *
 * Label state transitions (`hive:in-flight` -> `hive:shipped` |
 * `hive:failed`) are NOT this bridge's job — the workflow YAML owns
 * them so they survive bridge crashes via `if: failure()`.
 *
 * Scaffolded by `/hive:sandcastle-gh-init`. The `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
 * placeholder is substituted to one of:
 *   - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`  — `--secret-mode claude-oauth` (default).
 *     Long-lived headless OAuth token from `claude setup-token`;
 *     billed against the maintainer's Claude subscription. Read directly
 *     by the `claude` CLI inside the sandcastle container — no file
 *     mount or aliasing required (verified by the
 *     `.github/workflows/claude-auth-spike.yml` smoke test, 2026-05-17).
 *   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`        — `--secret-mode anthropic-api`
 *     (legacy per-token API billing path; back-compat for consumers who
 *     already wired the API-key secret).
 *   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`           — `--secret-mode openai`.
 *
 * `@ai-hero/sandcastle`'s `claudeCode()` provider does NOT hardcode an
 * auth env var name; it forwards whatever `env` the caller passes (and
 * what `process.env` carries) into the container, and the `claude` CLI
 * itself decides which credential to use at request time. So this
 * bridge just env-presence-checks the configured secret and lets
 * sandcastle's launch-time env merge do the rest.
